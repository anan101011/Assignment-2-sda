      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">Spy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Now you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "We can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Wit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.<br/>\n",

      "If I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.</span>\n",

      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "About the characters:<br/>\r\n",
      "I talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster's daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.<br/>\r\n",
      "Obviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "What I also didn't expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author's part.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Yor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn't make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn't have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Like the example in twinlight's scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don't cry\" and right after the end of twinlight's encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I'm going to cry.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Another thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "About the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "In the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.<br/>\r\n",
      "Flour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other's weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.<br/>\r\n",

      "I simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can't tell the difference between Wit's episodes and Cloverwork's episodes, because it's so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga's material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">is in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production's emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it's in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The primary appeal of Spy x Family isn't the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya's shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar's visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya's ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it's worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it's also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days. A brilliant adaptation we did not deserve, Spy x Family blends thrilling action, hilarious comedy and endearing characters to create an absolutely superb and well-rounded experience.

It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime.

However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Loid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Speaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "It’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. <br/>\n",

      "                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities &amp; motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here.

      "Remember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer &amp; utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, &amp; therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Let’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional &amp; act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "*one spoiler*<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen &amp; observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive &amp; vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they've proved they aren't completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, &amp; that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, &amp; it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians &amp; cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Where Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical &amp; cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless &amp; pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Watching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, &amp; they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP &amp; the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.<br/>\n",

Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We're quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it's done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don't get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense.

Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out.

And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone's mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it's just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let's get into this trio!<br/>\n",

The girl craves excitement, and since she's the only one who knows everything that's going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she's just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I'd honestly say that she's the most entertaining anime girl that I've seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!<br/>\n",

      "Of course there's also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She's probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She's pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he's not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target's voice, so I guess they're both equally over the top. But it's certainly fun to watch. <br/>\n",

When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I'm glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they're just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. <br/>\n",

      "Comedy is subjective, so Spy X Family certainly isn't for everyone. But if it's incredibly high scores aren't an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I'm sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I'd wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here's hoping for a sequel to continue Anya's quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it's Loid's mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">as Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Secondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "When anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "To end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "First off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.</span>\n",

      "In it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it's peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I'm still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it's a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I've seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it's an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn't break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I'd seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya's voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn't talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It's so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that's what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970's with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn't live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime's message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where's the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "For all what's it worth, for a best-selling manga, there's just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don't want to make a longer wall of text so I'm gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.</span>\n",

That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.\n",

      "  Now you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  We can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Anya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  But trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.\n",

      "  The big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase.\n",

      "  Wit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.\n",

      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Obviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  What I also didn't expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author's part.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Yor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn't make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn't have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  The script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Like the example in twinlight's scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don't cry\" and right after the end of twinlight's encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I'm going to cry.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Another thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.\n",

      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Flour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease.

If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production's emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it's in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  This anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  The primary appeal of Spy x Family isn't the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya's shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar's visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Anya's ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it's worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it's also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.\n",

      "  a review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  This is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Loid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Speaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  It’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  I’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest.\n",

      "  Remember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer &amp; utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, &amp; therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.\n",

I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Let’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional &amp; act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working.\n",

      "  I had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen &amp; observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  The presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive &amp; vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they've proved they aren't completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, &amp; that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, &amp; it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians &amp; cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production?\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Where Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical &amp; cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless &amp; pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony.\n",

If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, &amp; they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP &amp; the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.\n",

Viewers learn that the state of this anime's world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We're quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it's done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don't get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn't the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little.\n",

      "  What Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character's true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn't be a big deal.\n",

And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone's mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it's just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let's get into this trio!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Anya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I've seen, and she's incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she's the only one who knows everything that's going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she's just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I'd honestly say that she's the most entertaining anime girl that I've seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Of course there's also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She's probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She's pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he's not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target's voice, so I guess they're both equally over the top. But it's certainly fun to watch.\n",

      "  Spy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I'm glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they're just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show.\n",

But if it's incredibly high scores aren't an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I'm sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I'd wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here's hoping for a sequel to continue Anya's quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it's Loid's mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.\n",

Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Spy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Spy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  Secondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  When anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  This section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  To end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  <br/>\n",
      "  First off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.\n",

      "  Sifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there's nothing much to be excited for unless there's a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can't escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it's the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons.\n",

      "  (I'll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan.\n",

      "  In it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it's peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there.\n",

      "  I was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I'm still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it's a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I've seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it's an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn't break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I'd seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.\n",

      "  I love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya's voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn't talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It's so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that's what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970's with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn't live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime's message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where's the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.\n",

      "  For all what's it worth, for a best-selling manga, there's just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don't want to make a longer wall of text so I'm gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.\n",

       "[\"\\n                — Hello where, anime fans!\\r\\n— Hi, overhyped seasonal show № 6934. What do you wanna offer to us today?\\r\\n— Well, I'm a spy comedy about Kaguya and Shir... I mean, Lloyd and Yor. It's hilariously funny, just try it for yourself!\\r\\n— Meh, another comedy about nippon students or nippon freaks? We've seen tons of them every fucking season. Anything else?\\r\\n— B... but I don't use any Japanese cliches! I replaced them with 100% concentrated Western Cold War tropes.\\r\\n— Spy comedy in a Cold War setting? Like The Man from U.N.C.L.E or something?\\r\\n— Yeah, and both of the main characters don't know about each other secret\\n                  ...\\nidentities, like Mr. and Mrs. Smith!\\r\\n— Cool, and what about production values? Wit or maybe Cloverworks?\\r\\n— We couldn't decide, so we hired both of them!\\r\\n— Both of them? Hm... sounds cool, but that's still not enough for us. Maybe you have a new seasonal waifu to replace that girl... already forgot her name... from that show about h... hina dolls? New waifus are kinda meh. Shikimori is boring, Raphtalia is outdated...\\r\\n— Yeah, we have a kawaii anime little girl! Her name is Yotsub... I mean, Anya, and she is secretly a mind-reader!\\r\\n— Mind-reader?\\r\\n— Yeah, and she likes peanuts!\\r\\n— Peanuts?\\r\\n— Yeah, and... she doesn't like carrots.\\r\\n— OMG, IT'S A 10/10 STUFF, I REPEAT, 10/10!!!\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family is a nicely done comedy, and unless you have been living under a rock for three weeks, you already know everythin about it without this review. Yeah, it's funny, it's cool, it tries hard to adapt all manga jokes (sometimes even harder than need with 1 chapter/1 episode pacing, so these jokes can be slow or wrong-paced for some of the manga readers as myself). It's good, and... that's all.\\n\\r\\nSeriously, when I started to read this manga in 2019, I already knew that lots of people will hype possible anime adaptation and Anya’s cuteness. And yeah, I enjoyed this adaptation by myself, even if I neither Wit nor Cloverworks fan. However, some well done gags is mostly the only thing that this show can offer. Story? Basic level. Characters? Just a standard archetypes. Action? Director prefer SoL scenes. All that we need for this rating nowadays - some simple jokes, well done production qualities and kawaii anime girl? Maybe we'll know it someday.\\n\\r\\nShould you watch it? Yeah, why not. Just don’t expect a 10/10 masterpiece because of all this hype, cause it's just a simple and enjoyable comedy, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                I don\\'t consider SPY x FAMILY to be exceptional because it stands out as a \"masterpiece\" or \"mind-blowing\", but rather because it pushes all the right buttons. \\n\\r\\nIts over-the-top premise about a spy, assassin, and a psychic living as a family is a breath of fresh air from typical action-comedy shows. Consider a proposal with a grenade pin to be one of many examples of the sheer amount of ridiculousness in this show. Being able to handle a plot like this, however, is what makes it truly worth watching. One element that I particularly found enjoyable is how well the show is able to transition\\n                  ...\\nits plot. It can go from life & death situations to simple school work in a flash and still keep my attention. \\n\\r\\nWhile not relatable to an extent, the characters feel real and go through emotional problems that we all can connect with. What does family really mean? What do I really want? Their likeable personalities along with their mysterious backgrounds allow them to complement each other nicely, leading to interesting character dynamics. Overall, the characters are great, and this shines yet another spotlight into the show\\'s potential.\\n\\r\\nEven though the show is being done by the studio that brought us Tragic Egg Priority, WIT Studios also has a hand in the table. And it goes without saying that WIT has been nothing short of a TITAN in terms of anime production.\\n\\r\\nFrom the comedic moments to the heart warming ones, SPY x FAMILY intertwines the elements that make up this show into one complete package that is perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This show truly does not disappoint.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n                Spy x Family is an anime of the year candidate. Yes, I say this with confidence for it managed to exemplify entertainment at consistent quality. It's an anime that sells itself as exactly what it is without misleading the audience. And with such a marketing wheel behind the show, it managed to reach a large audience. There's plenty of reasons why I believe Spy x Family indeed deserves its rating and to be quite honest, this is one of the few anime that I can recommend just about anyone this year.\\n\\r\\nFirst, I want to congradulate Tatsuya Endou on putting himself on the map with his\\n                  ...\\nSpy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.\\n\\r\\nNow you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.\\n\\r\\nWe can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.\\n\\r\\nAnya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.\\n\\r\\nBut trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.\\n\\r\\nThe big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. \\n\\r\\nWit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.\\n\\r\\nIf I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Spy X Family met and exceeded my expectations. Twilight\\'s cold autistic behavior is well represented by his inner monologue, which is even a surprise, since his interaction with the adorable anya is quite charismatic, and all of this is elevated due to the direction, the comic timing, the faces and mouths, and the well-executed action that is very satisfying managing to mix the comedy with the serious moments. \\n\\r\\nHighlighting the production, the work is being produced by wit studio in conjunction with CloverWorks, both of which are always responsible for well-produced works. The production being divided between the two improves the fact, since besides the\\n                  ...\\nstaff being competent, it will hardly have difficulty with overloaded producers, especially by CloverWorks, which keeps picking up many anime a year.\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout the characters:\\r\\nI talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster\\'s daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.\\r\\nObviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.\\n\\r\\nWhat I also didn\\'t expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author\\'s part.\\n\\n\\r\\nYor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn\\'t make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn\\'t have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.\\n\\r\\nThe script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.\\n\\r\\nLike the example in twinlight\\'s scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don\\'t cry\" and right after the end of twinlight\\'s encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I\\'m going to cry.\\n\\r\\nAnother thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. \\n\\r\\nIn the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.\\r\\nFlour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other\\'s weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.\\r\\nAnd all of this establishing a pattern of its own, it is definitely an excellent anime.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n                Contains spoilers, Spoiler free TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\r\\n\"I like this show\" ~Anya Forger in episode 1.\\n\\r\\nYou could not have possibly missed this, Spy x Family has taken the community by storm. It is everywhere, be it in the form of Yor and Anya fanarts (with an appalling lack of Loid ones) or Anya smug face memes.\\n\\r\\nI simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can\\'t tell the difference between Wit\\'s episodes and Cloverwork\\'s episodes, because it\\'s so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga\\'s material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\\n                  ...\\nis in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production\\'s emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it\\'s in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.\\n\\r\\nThis anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.\\n\\r\\nThe primary appeal of Spy x Family isn\\'t the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya\\'s shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar\\'s visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. \\n\\r\\nAnya\\'s ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it\\'s worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it\\'s also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days. A brilliant adaptation we did not deserve, Spy x Family blends thrilling action, hilarious comedy and endearing characters to create an absolutely superb and well-rounded experience. Highly recommended indiscriminately to all anime fans. Thank you for reading.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n                SPY×FAMILY is the first mainstream anime to come out in a very long time that I can confidently say is worth the hype. I mean, it might be a bit overhyped, but what isn’t these days? I expected a generic, uninteresting, gimmicky piece of shounen-action trash, and what I got was a clever and oh-so-endearing slice of life with lovable characters, fantastic visual set pieces, a brilliant setting, and, if you can believe it, a genuinely funny sense of humor and gut-busting comedic timing. It’s way more simplistic and tensionless than I expected it to be, and that is a good thing. I recently wrote\\n                  ...\\na review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique. \\n\\r\\nThis is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.\\n\\r\\nLoid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. & Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. & Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. \\n\\r\\nIt’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.\\n\\r\\nI’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. \\n\\r\\nThank you for reading.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities & motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here. You know the show Anya watches on TV—Spy Wars, I guarantee that that show is more fun than this one. \\n\\r\\nAnyway, if you can’t already tell by that nice juicy two\\n                  ...\\nI’ve given there, I did not enjoy this show. And if you can’t stand the idea of someone talking shit about your favorite show, you should probably get out of here, because it’s only going to get worse from here on out. If you want to keep reading, though, then get your popcorn, & let’s fucking go.\\n\\r\\nRemember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer & utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, & therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.\\n\\r\\nBut FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.\\n\\r\\nLet’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional & act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. \\n\\r\\n*one spoiler*\\n\\r\\nI had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen & observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.\\n\\r\\nThe presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive & vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they\\'ve proved they aren\\'t completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, & that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, & it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians & cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? \\n\\r\\nWhere Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical & cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless & pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. \\n\\r\\nWatching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, & they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP & the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.\\n\\r\\nSpy × Family took a hilariously creative premise, and made the most boring show humanly possible out of it. If nothing else, that’s an achievement on its own.\\n\\r\\nThank you for reading.\\n',\n",

There hasn't been much of an honest bone to any character in what has been played out so far. I am certain this will shift however it doesn't change the fact that this anime is telling you that telling lies and being genuinely unauthentic are an acceptable means to build bonds on.\\n\\r\\nGiven that I said that and it is widely popular among the masses, I would also be a liar if I didn't say that this concerns me. I understand this is only an opinion, my opinion but I really do hold firm on what I said.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Where do I start? Spy x Family tries very hard to be funny but it comes off as rather awkward. All the main characters have this \"secret\" identity that they are trying to keep private but it is so achingly obvious that it ends up being one of the most aggravating things I have watched. The whole plot also revolves around this very complex political issue which we never get a lot of detail about which makes the story very confusing. The animation and art style are quite alright but they cannot compensate for the poorly written plot and characters.

In under 30 minutes, it delivers an impressive premiere episode that introduces a lived-in world and fleshed-out characters you can't help but love, all while doing a tricky balancing act of tones and genres that somehow blend seamlessly.

       " '\\n                Heh, I can\\'t believe how incredibly popular and highly rated Spy X Family has become. Especially when it isn\\'t an anime that contains a lot of the more \"epic\" or \"emotional\" moments that a lot of the other top shows on this site bring to the table. But I too have been captived by it\\'s charm ever since reading the Manga. So what\\'s the secret formula that makes Spy X Family a resounding success? Let\\'s dive into it, shall we?\\n\\r\\nAnd no, it\\'s not because the characters are relatable. There\\'s absolutely no way...unless of course you happen to be a spy, an esper, an assassin, or\\n                  ...\\nhave started a fake family for the sake of world peace. In which case yeah, I guess you could relate.\\n\\r\\nThe setup of the anime is solid without being too detailed. Viewers learn that the state of this anime\\'s world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We\\'re quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it\\'s done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don\\'t get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn\\'t the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little. \\n\\r\\nWhat Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character\\'s true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn\\'t be a big deal.\\n\\r\\nBut they are most certainly not normal.\\n\\r\\nI already mentioned how Loid is a spy. Well, his mission involves creating a family and having his child attend a prestigious school in order to get close to his target. And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone\\'s mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it\\'s just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let\\'s get into this trio!\\n\\r\\nAnya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I\\'ve seen, and she\\'s incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she\\'s the only one who knows everything that\\'s going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she\\'s just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I\\'d honestly say that she\\'s the most entertaining anime girl that I\\'ve seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!\\n\\r\\nOf course there\\'s also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She\\'s probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She\\'s pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he\\'s not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target\\'s voice, so I guess they\\'re both equally over the top. But it\\'s certainly fun to watch. \\n\\r\\nSpy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I\\'m glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they\\'re just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. \\n\\r\\nComedy is subjective, so Spy X Family certainly isn\\'t for everyone. But if it\\'s incredibly high scores aren\\'t an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I\\'m sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I\\'d wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here\\'s hoping for a sequel to continue Anya\\'s quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it\\'s Loid\\'s mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n                   This show is known from its plot twist like for instant. The background character is seeing regular couple but suddenly the couple does the complete opposite or doing something what they wouldn't expect. This is mostly what you get of the show, also the character development is cheesy lazy sentimental plot device, i been held captive by the system to be use as a child soldier and never been love but suddenly met a moe uwu loli girl type.\\n\\r\\n These sorta theme works well but the theme felt like a plot device for lazy wholesome fanservice pandering for casual anime watcher who\\n                  ...\\nonly want to get a reaction so that you can easily get invested into the character and don't have to feel overwhelmed. Its like as if you're doing a homework project in order to invest into a convincing historical period time setting event with its espionage CIA, KGB,CCP and MK ULTRA  for people that doesn't know the reference. These event aren't really tied into the plot, but is loosely based on it.\\n\\r\\nThe main premise is the only reason what got me interested in. Wanting to know how the story unfold of if he succeed the mission and develop himself to be the better man from realizing the concept of a healthy life such as feeling a person love and care from a sadistic hoe and a loli. I don't know why they didn't label the organization as terrorist instead of extremist since extremist are the one who would do like Boston bombing level, not a fucking war. I know they're going to reveal the main character past and trauma but it just going to be some forced overly projected edgy shock value reveal the main character, side character and opponent doing ahegao face with snot and drool or some corny ass scary face. \\n\\r\\nThe art is shit underwhelming over exaggerated out of place lazy town art.\\n\\r\\nThis show is only good if you want to feel good and be a cheer leader so you don't have to strain on the visual constructive narrative or exposition dialogue and some abstract artistic bullshit that would level headed watcher would say. But yeh anya is a cute loli that explain things by introducing her names first like a pokemon in order for her to explain things in a UWU way. yeh this show is like a 6 to a light 7ish and i unironically gave akebi-chan an 8.

       " \"\\n                Spy x Family is a story about Loid needing a family for his mission to accomplish world peace. It comes with a lot of struggles, but turns out for the best. As a manga reader I was very excited to see the results with Wit Studio and Cloverworks, and so far it didn't disappoint at all! \\n\\r\\nStory: 10\\r\\nThe story of Spy x Family is a really fun story to come in to. It's a original story and does things different from the others. It is a action/comedy series and compensates it with a good story. The action in the series are good so far and\\n                  ...\\nthe comedy is most of the time Anya. Most comedy anime don't have a really strong story or the characters don't have a strong background, but I liked it when they teased the backstory of Anya and Loid in the first episode. \\r\\nThere is a goal as well in this story. As I said it was to accomplish world peace and they do it in the most original way as possible. Without spoiling to much from what's coming, it is a very well written story with a lot of memorable characters so far!\\n\\r\\nArt: 9\\r\\nThe best thing about the art is that they adapt panels of the manga so well! Some studios don't do this, so they get a more dramatic effect or a better visual, but in my opinion is this a really good adaptation from the manga. Wit and Cloverworks are 2 big animation studios and they did this story so right with there animations. So far they didn't disappoint at all!\\n\\r\\nSound: 9\\r\\nThe sound is very fitting for this type of anime. It really gives you the vibe of being in a undercover mission. And when the scene switch up to a more wholesome setting, the music switches to that really well! The OP is in my opinion really good because it really fits the show in every way (listening as a manga reader) and the ED is as good if not better then the opening! I maybe get why some people don't like the OP too much, but that is more of a taste thing.\\n\\r\\nCharacters: 9\\r\\nThe characters are really memorable! If we look at the jokes they made or just the bad ass fights/moves they did, they are super memorable. Anya of course is the one that cracks the jokes with her facial expressions! Loid is always struggling to accomplish his mission and Yor is just a super lovable character (mommy). \\n\\r\\nEnjoyment: 10\\r\\nAs a manga reader, I really enjoy reading the manga and was very excited to see the results in a anime. Now that it's out, I am honestly so baffled of how well they made this anime!  I am always watching this on the edge of my seat and don't want to skip a minute of this show. I cannot wait for the next episodes that need to come out yet!\\n\\r\\nOverall: 10\\r\\nThis show has honestly the potential to be one of the best anime to come out. It all depends of how Wit and Cloverworks will adapt the other chapters from the manga! Let's just sit back and enjoy this masterpiece of a show!\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n                Mediocrity can mask itself in funny ways. When I think of the word “overrated”, I think of shows that have been able to hide their mediocrity in such admirable fashion that they do not get noticed by the majority of anime fans. We’ve had our fair share of overrated anime like Clannad which was able to mask its mediocrity with emotional p0rn, No game no life, and even more recently Sono bisque doll with its uncanny ability to cater to the most down bad section of weebs. But no mediocre anime has been able to reach such heights of popularity as quickly and as effortlessly\\n                  ...\\nas Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.\\n\\r\\nSpy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.\\n\\r\\nSpy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. \\n\\r\\nSecondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.\\n\\r\\nWhen anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.\\n\\r\\nThis section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.\\n\\r\\nTo end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.\\n\\r\\nFirst off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Imagine having the balls to propose in a middle of a gun fight with a grenade pin as a ring. A kid cheating on a crossword to get adopted. A lady that makes you forget best waifu of the season, coz she\\'s literally BEST WIFE arguably the past decade of anime. Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Yukino and Hachiman in an alternate reality, and with a child that bulldozes wholesomeness for everybody.\\n\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s right! Welcome to the bizarre cold-war world of this kickass-pseudo-family of three. \\n\\n\\r\\nIf you look closely, there\\'s at least 5 isekai anime that\\'s been airing per season for the last 4 seasons.\\n                  ...\\nSifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there\\'s nothing much to be excited for unless there\\'s a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can\\'t escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it\\'s the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons. \\n\\r\\n(I\\'ll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan. \\n\\r\\nIn it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it\\'s peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. \\n\\r\\nI was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I\\'m still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it\\'s a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I\\'ve seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it\\'s an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn\\'t break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I\\'d seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.\\n\\r\\nI love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya\\'s voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn\\'t talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It\\'s so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that\\'s what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970\\'s with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn\\'t live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime\\'s message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where\\'s the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don\\'t worry guys, I\\'ll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.\\n\\r\\nFor all what\\'s it worth, for a best-selling manga, there\\'s just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don\\'t want to make a longer wall of text so I\\'m gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.\\n',\n",

Yeah, it's funny, it's cool, it tries hard to adapt all manga jokes (sometimes even harder than need with 1 chapter/1 episode pacing, so these jokes can be slow or wrong-paced for some of the manga readers as myself). It's good, and... that's all.<br/>\n",

And yeah, I enjoyed this adaptation by myself, even if I neither Wit nor Cloverworks fan. However, some well done gags is mostly the only thing that this show can offer. Story? Basic level. Characters? Just a standard archetypes. Action? Director prefer SoL scenes. All that we need for this rating nowadays - some simple jokes, well done production qualities and kawaii anime girl? Maybe we'll know it someday.<br/>\n",

      "                Spy x Family is an anime of the year candidate. Yes, I say this with confidence for it managed to exemplify entertainment at consistent quality. It's an anime that sells itself as exactly what it is without misleading the audience. And with such a marketing wheel behind the show, it managed to reach a large audience. There's plenty of reasons why I believe Spy x Family indeed deserves its rating and to be quite honest, this is one of the few anime that I can recommend just about anyone this year.<br/>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">Spy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Now you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "We can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Wit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.<br/>\n",

      "If I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.</span>\n",

      "<br/>\r\n",
      "About the characters:<br/>\r\n",
      "I talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster's daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.<br/>\r\n",
      "Obviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "What I also didn't expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author's part.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Yor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn't make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn't have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Like the example in twinlight's scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don't cry\" and right after the end of twinlight's encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I'm going to cry.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Another thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.<br/>\n",

      "About the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "In the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.<br/>\r\n",
      "Flour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other's weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.<br/>\r\n",

      "\"I like this show\" ~Anya Forger in episode 1.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "You could not have possibly missed this, Spy x Family has taken the community by storm. It is everywhere, be it in the form of Yor and Anya fanarts (with an appalling lack of Loid ones) or Anya smug face memes.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can't tell the difference between Wit's episodes and Cloverwork's episodes, because it's so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga's material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">is in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production's emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it's in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The primary appeal of Spy x Family isn't the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya's shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar's visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya's ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it's worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it's also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.<br/>\n",

      "Spy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days. A brilliant adaptation we did not deserve, Spy x Family blends thrilling action, hilarious comedy and endearing characters to create an absolutely superb and well-rounded experience. Highly recommended indiscriminately to all anime fans. Thank you for reading.</span>\n",

      "                SPY×FAMILY is the first mainstream anime to come out in a very long time that I can confidently say is worth the hype. I mean, it might be a bit overhyped, but what isn’t these days? I expected a generic, uninteresting, gimmicky piece of shounen-action trash, and what I got was a clever and oh-so-endearing slice of life with lovable characters, fantastic visual set pieces, a brilliant setting, and, if you can believe it, a genuinely funny sense of humor and gut-busting comedic timing. It’s way more simplistic and tensionless than I expected it to be, and that is a good thing. I recently wrote\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">a review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Loid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Speaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "It’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.<br/>\n",

      "I’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. <br/>\n",

      "                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities &amp; motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here. You know the show Anya watches on TV—Spy Wars, I guarantee that that show is more fun than this one. <br/>\n",

And if you can’t stand the idea of someone talking shit about your favorite show, you should probably get out of here, because it’s only going to get worse from here on out. If you want to keep reading, though, then get your popcorn, &amp; let’s fucking go.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Remember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer &amp; utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, &amp; therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Let’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional &amp; act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "*one spoiler*<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen &amp; observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive &amp; vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they've proved they aren't completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, &amp; that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, &amp; it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians &amp; cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Where Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical &amp; cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless &amp; pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Watching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, &amp; they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP &amp; the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.<br/>\n",

In under 30 minutes, it delivers an impressive premiere episode that introduces a lived-in world and fleshed-out characters you can't help but love, all while doing a tricky balancing act of tones and genres that somehow blend seamlessly.

      "                Heh, I can't believe how incredibly popular and highly rated Spy X Family has become. Especially when it isn't an anime that contains a lot of the more \"epic\" or \"emotional\" moments that a lot of the other top shows on this site bring to the table. But I too have been captived by it's charm ever since reading the Manga. So what's the secret formula that makes Spy X Family a resounding success? Let's dive into it, shall we?<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "And no, it's not because the characters are relatable. There's absolutely no way...unless of course you happen to be a spy, an esper, an assassin, or\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">have started a fake family for the sake of world peace. In which case yeah, I guess you could relate.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The setup of the anime is solid without being too detailed. Viewers learn that the state of this anime's world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We're quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it's done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don't get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn't the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "What Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character's true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn't be a big deal.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But they are most certainly not normal.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I already mentioned how Loid is a spy. Well, his mission involves creating a family and having his child attend a prestigious school in order to get close to his target. And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone's mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it's just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let's get into this trio!<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I've seen, and she's incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she's the only one who knows everything that's going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she's just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I'd honestly say that she's the most entertaining anime girl that I've seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Of course there's also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She's probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She's pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he's not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target's voice, so I guess they're both equally over the top. But it's certainly fun to watch. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I'm glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they're just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Comedy is subjective, so Spy X Family certainly isn't for everyone. But if it's incredibly high scores aren't an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I'm sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I'd wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here's hoping for a sequel to continue Anya's quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it's Loid's mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.</span>\n",

The OP is in my opinion really good because it really fits the show in every way (listening as a manga reader) and the ED is as good if not better then the opening!

      "                Mediocrity can mask itself in funny ways. When I think of the word “overrated”, I think of shows that have been able to hide their mediocrity in such admirable fashion that they do not get noticed by the majority of anime fans. We’ve had our fair share of overrated anime like Clannad which was able to mask its mediocrity with emotional p0rn, No game no life, and even more recently Sono bisque doll with its uncanny ability to cater to the most down bad section of weebs. But no mediocre anime has been able to reach such heights of popularity as quickly and as effortlessly\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">as Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Secondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "When anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "To end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.<br/>\n",

      "First off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">Sifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there's nothing much to be excited for unless there's a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can't escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it's the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "(I'll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "In it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it's peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I'm still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it's a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I've seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it's an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn't break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I'd seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya's voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn't talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It's so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that's what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970's with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn't live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime's message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where's the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "For all what's it worth, for a best-selling manga, there's just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don't want to make a longer wall of text so I'm gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.</span>\n",

I don't know what's going to happen or if the upcoming episodes are going to be that great but Spy x Family already has a special place in my heart and this is definitely going to be one of the best anime's to come out in 2022. Be sure to watch it , do not listen to someone else and stop your plans of watching this anime, you deserve to watch this beautifully created show! ;)<br/>\n",

      "Spy x Family is a nicely done comedy, and unless you have been living under a rock for three weeks, you already know everythin about it without this review. Yeah, it's funny, it's cool, it tries hard to adapt all manga jokes (sometimes even harder than need with 1 chapter/1 episode pacing, so these jokes can be slow or wrong-paced for some of the manga readers as myself). It's good, and... that's all.<br/>\n",

And yeah, I enjoyed this adaptation by myself, even if I neither Wit nor Cloverworks fan. However, some well done gags is mostly the only thing that this show can offer. Story? Basic level. Characters? Just a standard archetypes. Action? Director prefer SoL scenes. All that we need for this rating nowadays - some simple jokes, well done production qualities and kawaii anime girl? Maybe we'll know it someday.<br/>\n",

      "                Spy x Family is an anime of the year candidate. Yes, I say this with confidence for it managed to exemplify entertainment at consistent quality. It's an anime that sells itself as exactly what it is without misleading the audience. And with such a marketing wheel behind the show, it managed to reach a large audience. There's plenty of reasons why I believe Spy x Family indeed deserves its rating and to be quite honest, this is one of the few anime that I can recommend just about anyone this year.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "First, I want to congradulate Tatsuya Endou on putting himself on the map with his\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">Spy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Now you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "We can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Wit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "If I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.</span>\n",

      "                Spy X Family met and exceeded my expectations. Twilight's cold autistic behavior is well represented by his inner monologue, which is even a surprise, since his interaction with the adorable anya is quite charismatic, and all of this is elevated due to the direction, the comic timing, the faces and mouths, and the well-executed action that is very satisfying managing to mix the comedy with the serious moments. <br/>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">staff being competent, it will hardly have difficulty with overloaded producers, especially by CloverWorks, which keeps picking up many anime a year.<br/>\n",

      "<br/>\r\n",
      "About the characters:<br/>\r\n",
      "I talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster's daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.<br/>\r\n",
      "Obviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "What I also didn't expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author's part.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Yor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn't make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn't have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Like the example in twinlight's scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don't cry\" and right after the end of twinlight's encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I'm going to cry.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Another thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "About the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "In the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.<br/>\r\n",
      "Flour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other's weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.<br/>\r\n",
      "And all of this establishing a pattern of its own, it is definitely an excellent anime.</span>\n",

      "\"I like this show\" ~Anya Forger in episode 1.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "You could not have possibly missed this, Spy x Family has taken the community by storm. It is everywhere, be it in the form of Yor and Anya fanarts (with an appalling lack of Loid ones) or Anya smug face memes.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can't tell the difference between Wit's episodes and Cloverwork's episodes, because it's so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga's material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">is in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production's emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it's in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The primary appeal of Spy x Family isn't the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya's shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar's visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya's ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it's worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it's also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days. A brilliant adaptation we did not deserve, Spy x Family blends thrilling action, hilarious comedy and endearing characters to create an absolutely superb and well-rounded experience. Highly recommended indiscriminately to all anime fans. Thank you for reading.</span>\n",

      "                SPY×FAMILY is the first mainstream anime to come out in a very long time that I can confidently say is worth the hype. I mean, it might be a bit overhyped, but what isn’t these days? I expected a generic, uninteresting, gimmicky piece of shounen-action trash, and what I got was a clever and oh-so-endearing slice of life with lovable characters, fantastic visual set pieces, a brilliant setting, and, if you can believe it, a genuinely funny sense of humor and gut-busting comedic timing. It’s way more simplistic and tensionless than I expected it to be, and that is a good thing. I recently wrote\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">a review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Loid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Speaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "It’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. <br/>\n",

      "                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities &amp; motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here. You know the show Anya watches on TV—Spy Wars, I guarantee that that show is more fun than this one. <br/>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">I’ve given there, I did not enjoy this show. And if you can’t stand the idea of someone talking shit about your favorite show, you should probably get out of here, because it’s only going to get worse from here on out. If you want to keep reading, though, then get your popcorn, &amp; let’s fucking go.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Remember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer &amp; utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, &amp; therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Let’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional &amp; act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "*one spoiler*<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen &amp; observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive &amp; vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they've proved they aren't completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, &amp; that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, &amp; it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians &amp; cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Where Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical &amp; cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless &amp; pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Watching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, &amp; they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP &amp; the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy × Family took a hilariously creative premise, and made the most boring show humanly possible out of it. If nothing else, that’s an achievement on its own.<br/>\n",

All the main characters have this \"secret\" identity that they are trying to keep private but it is so achingly obvious that it ends up being one of the most aggravating things I have watched. The whole plot also revolves around this very complex political issue which we never get a lot of detail about which makes the story very confusing. The animation and art style are quite alright but they cannot compensate for the poorly written plot and characters. Overall, I would not recommend\n",

      "                Heh, I can't believe how incredibly popular and highly rated Spy X Family has become. Especially when it isn't an anime that contains a lot of the more \"epic\" or \"emotional\" moments that a lot of the other top shows on this site bring to the table. But I too have been captived by it's charm ever since reading the Manga. So what's the secret formula that makes Spy X Family a resounding success? Let's dive into it, shall we?<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "And no, it's not because the characters are relatable. There's absolutely no way...unless of course you happen to be a spy, an esper, an assassin, or\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">have started a fake family for the sake of world peace. In which case yeah, I guess you could relate.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "The setup of the anime is solid without being too detailed. Viewers learn that the state of this anime's world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We're quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it's done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don't get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn't the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "What Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character's true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn't be a big deal.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "But they are most certainly not normal.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I already mentioned how Loid is a spy. Well, his mission involves creating a family and having his child attend a prestigious school in order to get close to his target. And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone's mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it's just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let's get into this trio!<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Anya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I've seen, and she's incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she's the only one who knows everything that's going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she's just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I'd honestly say that she's the most entertaining anime girl that I've seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Of course there's also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She's probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She's pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he's not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target's voice, so I guess they're both equally over the top. But it's certainly fun to watch. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I'm glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they're just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Comedy is subjective, so Spy X Family certainly isn't for everyone. But if it's incredibly high scores aren't an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I'm sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I'd wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here's hoping for a sequel to continue Anya's quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it's Loid's mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.</span>\n",

      "                Mediocrity can mask itself in funny ways. When I think of the word “overrated”, I think of shows that have been able to hide their mediocrity in such admirable fashion that they do not get noticed by the majority of anime fans. We’ve had our fair share of overrated anime like Clannad which was able to mask its mediocrity with emotional p0rn, No game no life, and even more recently Sono bisque doll with its uncanny ability to cater to the most down bad section of weebs. But no mediocre anime has been able to reach such heights of popularity as quickly and as effortlessly\n",
      "                  <span class=\"js-visible\" style=\"margin-left: -4px;\">...</span>\n",
      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">as Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Spy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Secondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "When anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "This section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "To end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "First off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.</span>\n",

      "<span class=\"js-hidden\" style=\"display: none;\">Sifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there's nothing much to be excited for unless there's a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can't escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it's the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "(I'll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "In it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it's peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. <br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I'm still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it's a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I've seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it's an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn't break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I'd seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "I love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya's voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn't talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It's so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that's what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970's with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn't live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime's message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where's the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "For all what's it worth, for a best-selling manga, there's just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don't want to make a longer wall of text so I'm gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.</span>\n",

      "Every scene of this show feels like a treat to watch. The characters are great, the voice actors did a great job and were almost perfectly casted. Specially the voice actor of Anya ( Tanezaki, Atsumi ) did a great job and made Anya even cuter than she was before.<br/>\r\n",

      "I won't make my review too long and I'd like say that it's a really great show ( so far ) and you should definitely give it a watch. I don't know what's going to happen or if the upcoming episodes are going to be that great but Spy x Family already has a special place in my heart and this is definitely going to be one of the best anime's to come out in 2022. Be sure to watch it , do not listen to someone else and stop your plans of watching this anime, you deserve to watch this beautifully created show! ;)<br/>\n",
      "<br/>\r\n",
      "Finally I'd like to say, everyone has different tastes and opinions regarding a particular show, so feel free to share your own opinions. I just don't want anyone spreading any hate regarding any show, just watch whatever you like and enjoy! :)<br/>\r\n",

       "[\"\\n                — Hello where, anime fans!\\r\\n— Hi, overhyped seasonal show № 6934. What do you wanna offer to us today?\\r\\n— Well, I'm a spy comedy about Kaguya and Shir... I mean, Lloyd and Yor. It's hilariously funny, just try it for yourself!\\r\\n— Meh, another comedy about nippon students or nippon freaks? We've seen tons of them every fucking season. Anything else?\\r\\n— B... but I don't use any Japanese cliches! I replaced them with 100% concentrated Western Cold War tropes.\\r\\n— Spy comedy in a Cold War setting? Like The Man from U.N.C.L.E or something?\\r\\n— Yeah, and both of the main characters don't know about each other secret\\n                  ...\\nidentities, like Mr. and Mrs. Smith!\\r\\n— Cool, and what about production values? Wit or maybe Cloverworks?\\r\\n— We couldn't decide, so we hired both of them!\\r\\n— Both of them? Hm... sounds cool, but that's still not enough for us. Maybe you have a new seasonal waifu to replace that girl... already forgot her name... from that show about h... hina dolls? New waifus are kinda meh. Shikimori is boring, Raphtalia is outdated...\\r\\n— Yeah, we have a kawaii anime little girl! Her name is Yotsub... I mean, Anya, and she is secretly a mind-reader!\\r\\n— Mind-reader?\\r\\n— Yeah, and she likes peanuts!\\r\\n— Peanuts?\\r\\n— Yeah, and... she doesn't like carrots.\\r\\n— OMG, IT'S A 10/10 STUFF, I REPEAT, 10/10!!!\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family is a nicely done comedy, and unless you have been living under a rock for three weeks, you already know everythin about it without this review. Yeah, it's funny, it's cool, it tries hard to adapt all manga jokes (sometimes even harder than need with 1 chapter/1 episode pacing, so these jokes can be slow or wrong-paced for some of the manga readers as myself). It's good, and... that's all.\\n\\r\\nSeriously, when I started to read this manga in 2019, I already knew that lots of people will hype possible anime adaptation and Anya’s cuteness. And yeah, I enjoyed this adaptation by myself, even if I neither Wit nor Cloverworks fan. However, some well done gags is mostly the only thing that this show can offer. Story? Basic level. Characters? Just a standard archetypes. Action? Director prefer SoL scenes. All that we need for this rating nowadays - some simple jokes, well done production qualities and kawaii anime girl? Maybe we'll know it someday.\\n\\r\\nShould you watch it? Yeah, why not. Just don’t expect a 10/10 masterpiece because of all this hype, cause it's just a simple and enjoyable comedy, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                I don\\'t consider SPY x FAMILY to be exceptional because it stands out as a \"masterpiece\" or \"mind-blowing\", but rather because it pushes all the right buttons. \\n\\r\\nIts over-the-top premise about a spy, assassin, and a psychic living as a family is a breath of fresh air from typical action-comedy shows. Consider a proposal with a grenade pin to be one of many examples of the sheer amount of ridiculousness in this show. Being able to handle a plot like this, however, is what makes it truly worth watching. One element that I particularly found enjoyable is how well the show is able to transition\\n                  ...\\nits plot. It can go from life & death situations to simple school work in a flash and still keep my attention. \\n\\r\\nWhile not relatable to an extent, the characters feel real and go through emotional problems that we all can connect with. What does family really mean? What do I really want? Their likeable personalities along with their mysterious backgrounds allow them to complement each other nicely, leading to interesting character dynamics. Overall, the characters are great, and this shines yet another spotlight into the show\\'s potential.\\n\\r\\nEven though the show is being done by the studio that brought us Tragic Egg Priority, WIT Studios also has a hand in the table. And it goes without saying that WIT has been nothing short of a TITAN in terms of anime production.\\n\\r\\nFrom the comedic moments to the heart warming ones, SPY x FAMILY intertwines the elements that make up this show into one complete package that is perfectly balanced, as all things should be. This show truly does not disappoint.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n                Spy x Family is an anime of the year candidate. Yes, I say this with confidence for it managed to exemplify entertainment at consistent quality. It's an anime that sells itself as exactly what it is without misleading the audience. And with such a marketing wheel behind the show, it managed to reach a large audience. There's plenty of reasons why I believe Spy x Family indeed deserves its rating and to be quite honest, this is one of the few anime that I can recommend just about anyone this year.\\n\\r\\nFirst, I want to congradulate Tatsuya Endou on putting himself on the map with his\\n                  ...\\nSpy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.\\n\\r\\nNow you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.\\n\\r\\nWe can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.\\n\\r\\nAnya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.\\n\\r\\nBut trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.\\n\\r\\nThe big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. \\n\\r\\nWit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.\\n\\r\\nIf I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Spy X Family met and exceeded my expectations. Twilight\\'s cold autistic behavior is well represented by his inner monologue, which is even a surprise, since his interaction with the adorable anya is quite charismatic, and all of this is elevated due to the direction, the comic timing, the faces and mouths, and the well-executed action that is very satisfying managing to mix the comedy with the serious moments. \\n\\r\\nHighlighting the production, the work is being produced by wit studio in conjunction with CloverWorks, both of which are always responsible for well-produced works. The production being divided between the two improves the fact, since besides the\\n                  ...\\nstaff being competent, it will hardly have difficulty with overloaded producers, especially by CloverWorks, which keeps picking up many anime a year.\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout the characters:\\r\\nI talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster\\'s daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.\\r\\nObviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.\\n\\r\\nWhat I also didn\\'t expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author\\'s part.\\n\\n\\r\\nYor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn\\'t make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn\\'t have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.\\n\\r\\nThe script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.\\n\\r\\nLike the example in twinlight\\'s scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don\\'t cry\" and right after the end of twinlight\\'s encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I\\'m going to cry.\\n\\r\\nAnother thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.\\n\\n\\r\\nAbout the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. \\n\\r\\nIn the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.\\r\\nFlour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other\\'s weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.\\r\\nAnd all of this establishing a pattern of its own, it is definitely an excellent anime.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n                Contains spoilers, Spoiler free TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\r\\n\"I like this show\" ~Anya Forger in episode 1.\\n\\r\\nYou could not have possibly missed this, Spy x Family has taken the community by storm. It is everywhere, be it in the form of Yor and Anya fanarts (with an appalling lack of Loid ones) or Anya smug face memes.\\n\\r\\nI simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can\\'t tell the difference between Wit\\'s episodes and Cloverwork\\'s episodes, because it\\'s so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga\\'s material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\\n                  ...\\nis in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production\\'s emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it\\'s in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.\\n\\r\\nThis anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.\\n\\r\\nThe primary appeal of Spy x Family isn\\'t the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya\\'s shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar\\'s visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. \\n\\r\\nAnya\\'s ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it\\'s worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it\\'s also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.\\n\\r\\nSpy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days. A brilliant adaptation we did not deserve, Spy x Family blends thrilling action, hilarious comedy and endearing characters to create an absolutely superb and well-rounded experience. Highly recommended indiscriminately to all anime fans. Thank you for reading.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n                SPY×FAMILY is the first mainstream anime to come out in a very long time that I can confidently say is worth the hype. I mean, it might be a bit overhyped, but what isn’t these days? I expected a generic, uninteresting, gimmicky piece of shounen-action trash, and what I got was a clever and oh-so-endearing slice of life with lovable characters, fantastic visual set pieces, a brilliant setting, and, if you can believe it, a genuinely funny sense of humor and gut-busting comedic timing. It’s way more simplistic and tensionless than I expected it to be, and that is a good thing. I recently wrote\\n                  ...\\na review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique. \\n\\r\\nThis is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.\\n\\r\\nLoid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. & Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. & Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.\\n\\r\\nSpeaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. \\n\\r\\nIt’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.\\n\\r\\nI’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. \\n\\r\\nThank you for reading.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities & motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here. You know the show Anya watches on TV—Spy Wars, I guarantee that that show is more fun than this one. \\n\\r\\nAnyway, if you can’t already tell by that nice juicy two\\n                  ...\\nI’ve given there, I did not enjoy this show. And if you can’t stand the idea of someone talking shit about your favorite show, you should probably get out of here, because it’s only going to get worse from here on out. If you want to keep reading, though, then get your popcorn, & let’s fucking go.\\n\\r\\nRemember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer & utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, & therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.\\n\\r\\nBut FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.\\n\\r\\nLet’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional & act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. \\n\\r\\n*one spoiler*\\n\\r\\nI had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen & observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.\\n\\r\\nThe presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive & vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they\\'ve proved they aren\\'t completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, & that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, & it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians & cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? \\n\\r\\nWhere Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical & cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless & pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. \\n\\r\\nWatching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, & they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP & the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.\\n\\r\\nSpy × Family took a hilariously creative premise, and made the most boring show humanly possible out of it. If nothing else, that’s an achievement on its own.\\n\\r\\nThank you for reading.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n                *Update: with the airing of the last episode? yeah, my rating will not be changed.\\n\\r\\nIm afraid I am going to come on a bit strong for this anime seeing as it isn't quite finished yet, however\\n\\r\\nI was kind of wondering if this would follow an The Incredibles way of playing out but I was wrong. The plot is oversimplified and bland. The story building works with very little to start off with and tosses a cocktail of random elements to forcibly make it work. The main character Loid is dry with some nodes of humor but not unlikable. Anya is as typical as you can\\n                  ...\\nget for a kid who contains abilities and Yor is the odd duck tossed in for just because. An awkward trio set out to do good in the world sounds like an awesome premise but it falls flat. The animation is alright at least and the music isn't half bad!\\n\\r\\nHowever, the premise that has been given so far is, Fake It Till You Make It. There hasn't been much of an honest bone to any character in what has been played out so far. I am certain this will shift however it doesn't change the fact that this anime is telling you that telling lies and being genuinely unauthentic are an acceptable means to build bonds on.\\n\\r\\nGiven that I said that and it is widely popular among the masses, I would also be a liar if I didn't say that this concerns me. I understand this is only an opinion, my opinion but I really do hold firm on what I said.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Where do I start? Spy x Family tries very hard to be funny but it comes off as rather awkward. All the main characters have this \"secret\" identity that they are trying to keep private but it is so achingly obvious that it ends up being one of the most aggravating things I have watched. The whole plot also revolves around this very complex political issue which we never get a lot of detail about which makes the story very confusing. The animation and art style are quite alright but they cannot compensate for the poorly written plot and characters. Overall, I would not recommend\\n                  ...\\nthis anime to anyone as it does not provide anything but an example of how to not develop a storyline correctly.\\n',\n",

The personality of the characters are not natural so it won't make you feel something for any characters because they are godlike, except for the little girl.

       " \"\\n                Some shows take a couple of episodes to really sell their premise, but Spy x Family (the x is silent, like in Hunter x Hunter) comes out of the gate swinging. In under 30 minutes, it delivers an impressive premiere episode that introduces a lived-in world and fleshed-out characters you can't help but love, all while doing a tricky balancing act of tones and genres that somehow blend seamlessly. Whether you've been waiting years for one of the most popular current manga to be adapted or are simply curious enough to watch a collaboration between the studios behind Ranking of Kings and My Dress-Up Darling,\\n                  ...\\nthis is already the most impressive premiere of the season.\\n\\r\\nStudio CloverWorks and WIT went HARD on the animation and I'm very glad they did. Even outside the action scenes it shows an impressive amount of character animation even in the smallest moments of comedic bits. The fights – and you better believe there are fights – hit surprisingly hard.\\n\\r\\nIt is too early to say whether the show will maintain this level of quality over the course of its first season, and it is also hard to judge a new show based on three episodes. Still, Spy x Family has one of the most impressive and memorable anime debuts in a while, one that promises a fun, exhilarating, wholesome, and also action-packed experience.\\n\\r\\nPS - I'll write a better review when I've completed 5 episodes. Hopefully the animation stays consistent and *psssst* *maybe this'll pass FMAB?* kek\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Heh, I can\\'t believe how incredibly popular and highly rated Spy X Family has become. Especially when it isn\\'t an anime that contains a lot of the more \"epic\" or \"emotional\" moments that a lot of the other top shows on this site bring to the table. But I too have been captived by it\\'s charm ever since reading the Manga. So what\\'s the secret formula that makes Spy X Family a resounding success? Let\\'s dive into it, shall we?\\n\\r\\nAnd no, it\\'s not because the characters are relatable. There\\'s absolutely no way...unless of course you happen to be a spy, an esper, an assassin, or\\n                  ...\\nhave started a fake family for the sake of world peace. In which case yeah, I guess you could relate.\\n\\r\\nThe setup of the anime is solid without being too detailed. Viewers learn that the state of this anime\\'s world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We\\'re quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it\\'s done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don\\'t get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn\\'t the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little. \\n\\r\\nWhat Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character\\'s true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn\\'t be a big deal.\\n\\r\\nBut they are most certainly not normal.\\n\\r\\nI already mentioned how Loid is a spy. Well, his mission involves creating a family and having his child attend a prestigious school in order to get close to his target. And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone\\'s mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it\\'s just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let\\'s get into this trio!\\n\\r\\nAnya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I\\'ve seen, and she\\'s incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she\\'s the only one who knows everything that\\'s going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she\\'s just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I\\'d honestly say that she\\'s the most entertaining anime girl that I\\'ve seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!\\n\\r\\nOf course there\\'s also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She\\'s probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She\\'s pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he\\'s not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target\\'s voice, so I guess they\\'re both equally over the top. But it\\'s certainly fun to watch. \\n\\r\\nSpy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I\\'m glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they\\'re just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. \\n\\r\\nComedy is subjective, so Spy X Family certainly isn\\'t for everyone. But if it\\'s incredibly high scores aren\\'t an indicator, this is certainly one of the best comedies in anime, which can be attributed to the wonderful writing and masterfully set up characters. It has things that I\\'m sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I\\'d wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here\\'s hoping for a sequel to continue Anya\\'s quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it\\'s Loid\\'s mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.\\n',\n",

The action in the series are good so far and\\n                  ...\\nthe comedy is most of the time Anya. Most comedy anime don't have a really strong story or the characters don't have a strong background, but I liked it when they teased the backstory of Anya and Loid in the first episode. \\r\\nThere is a goal as well in this story. As I said it was to accomplish world peace and they do it in the most original way as possible. Without spoiling to much from what's coming, it is a very well written story with a lot of memorable characters so far!\\n\\r\\nArt: 9\\r\\nThe best thing about the art is that they adapt panels of the manga so well! Some studios don't do this, so they get a more dramatic effect or a better visual, but in my opinion is this a really good adaptation from the manga. Wit and Cloverworks are 2 big animation studios and they did this story so right with there animations. So far they didn't disappoint at all!\\n\\r\\nSound: 9\\r\\nThe sound is very fitting for this type of anime. It really gives you the vibe of being in a undercover mission. And when the scene switch up to a more wholesome setting, the music switches to that really well! The OP is in my opinion really good because it really fits the show in every way (listening as a manga reader) and the ED is as good if not better then the opening! I maybe get why some people don't like the OP too much, but that is more of a taste thing.\\n\\r\\nCharacters: 9\\r\\nThe characters are really memorable! If we look at the jokes they made or just the bad ass fights/moves they did, they are super memorable. Anya of course is the one that cracks the jokes with her facial expressions! Loid is always struggling to accomplish his mission and Yor is just a super lovable character (mommy). \\n\\r\\nEnjoyment: 10\\r\\nAs a manga reader, I really enjoy reading the manga and was very excited to see the results in a anime. Now that it's out, I am honestly so baffled of how well they made this anime!  I am always watching this on the edge of my seat and don't want to skip a minute of this show. I cannot wait for the next episodes that need to come out yet!\\n\\r\\nOverall: 10\\r\\nThis show has honestly the potential to be one of the best anime to come out. It all depends of how Wit and Cloverworks will adapt the other chapters from the manga! Let's just sit back and enjoy this masterpiece of a show!\\n\",\n",

When I think of the word “overrated”, I think of shows that have been able to hide their mediocrity in such admirable fashion that they do not get noticed by the majority of anime fans. We’ve had our fair share of overrated anime like Clannad which was able to mask its mediocrity with emotional p0rn, No game no life, and even more recently Sono bisque doll with its uncanny ability to cater to the most down bad section of weebs. But no mediocre anime has been able to reach such heights of popularity as quickly and as effortlessly\\n                  ...\\nas Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.\\n\\r\\nSpy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.\\n\\r\\nSpy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. \\n\\r\\nSecondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.\\n\\r\\nWhen anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.\\n\\r\\nThis section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.\\n\\r\\nTo end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.\\n\\r\\nFirst off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n                Imagine having the balls to propose in a middle of a gun fight with a grenade pin as a ring. A kid cheating on a crossword to get adopted. A lady that makes you forget best waifu of the season, coz she\\'s literally BEST WIFE arguably the past decade of anime. Mr. and Mrs. Smith played by Yukino and Hachiman in an alternate reality, and with a child that bulldozes wholesomeness for everybody.\\n\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s right! Welcome to the bizarre cold-war world of this kickass-pseudo-family of three. \\n\\n\\r\\nIf you look closely, there\\'s at least 5 isekai anime that\\'s been airing per season for the last 4 seasons.\\n                  ...\\nSifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there\\'s nothing much to be excited for unless there\\'s a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can\\'t escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it\\'s the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons. \\n\\r\\n(I\\'ll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan. \\n\\r\\nIn it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it\\'s peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. \\n\\r\\nI was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I\\'m still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it\\'s a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I\\'ve seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it\\'s an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn\\'t break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I\\'d seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.\\n\\r\\nI love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya\\'s voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn\\'t talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It\\'s so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that\\'s what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970\\'s with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn\\'t live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime\\'s message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where\\'s the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don\\'t worry guys, I\\'ll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.\\n\\r\\nFor all what\\'s it worth, for a best-selling manga, there\\'s just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don\\'t want to make a longer wall of text so I\\'m gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n                Before I jump into my review , I'd like to say that this is my first ever review not only on MAL but this is the first time I'm writing a review for any TV show/Anime.                  I was actually excited for this and was literally waiting for the third episode to air so that I could write a review.\\r\\nNow time for my review :)\\n\\r\\nSo, Spy x Family , a rather interesting anime with such interesting characters and a beautiful soundtrack backed up by WIT Studio and Clover Works\\n                  ...\\n( Thank God they did that ). So with all this you probably can expect something good coming out.\\r\\n I've already read a few chapters of the manga and was really excited when I heard that it's about to get an adaptation (who wouldn't be after reading the manga XD).\\r\\nI really had high hopes for this and I'm grateful that it turned out the way I was expecting it to be. \\r\\nSpy x Family is beautifully adapted and was able to capture the essence of the manga. \\r\\nThe comedy was spot on, right up to my alley, I was not at all disappointed.\\r\\nEvery scene of this show feels like a treat to watch. The characters are great, the voice actors did a great job and were almost perfectly casted. Specially the voice actor of Anya ( Tanezaki, Atsumi ) did a great job and made Anya even cuter than she was before.\\r\\nI'm really happy that it's getting the attention it deserves. Some people might say that it's hyped but I'd like to say that it deserves the hype!\\n\\r\\nI won't make my review too long and I'd like say that it's a really great show ( so far ) and you should definitely give it a watch. I don't know what's going to happen or if the upcoming episodes are going to be that great but Spy x Family already has a special place in my heart and this is definitely going to be one of the best anime's to come out in 2022. Be sure to watch it , do not listen to someone else and stop your plans of watching this anime, you deserve to watch this beautifully created show! ;)\\n\\r\\nFinally I'd like to say, everyone has different tastes and opinions regarding a particular show, so feel free to share your own opinions. I just don't want anyone spreading any hate regarding any show, just watch whatever you like and enjoy! :)\\r\\nI hope you found this review helpful in any way. I'll try to upload an updated review after all the episodes are finished airing.\\r\\nTill then sayonara!\\n\\r\\nTHANK YOU!\\n\"]"

Yeah, it's funny, it's cool, it tries hard to adapt all manga jokes (sometimes even harder than need with 1 chapter/1 episode pacing, so these jokes can be slow or wrong-paced for some of the manga readers as myself). It's good, and... that's all.\n",

      "Seriously, when I started to read this manga in 2019, I already knew that lots of people will hype possible anime adaptation and Anya’s cuteness. And yeah, I enjoyed this adaptation by myself, even if I neither Wit nor Cloverworks fan. However, some well done gags is mostly the only thing that this show can offer. Story? Basic level. Characters? Just a standard archetypes. Action? Director prefer SoL scenes. All that we need for this rating nowadays - some simple jokes, well done production qualities and kawaii anime girl? Maybe we'll know it someday.\n",

Being able to handle a plot like this, however, is what makes it truly worth watching. One element that I particularly found enjoyable is how well the show is able to transition\n",

It's an anime that sells itself as exactly what it is without misleading the audience. And with such a marketing wheel behind the show, it managed to reach a large audience. There's plenty of reasons why I believe Spy x Family indeed deserves its rating and to be quite honest, this is one of the few anime that I can recommend just about anyone this year.\n",

      "Spy x Family franchise. To be honest, before Spy x Family launched, I don't remember any of his previous works. His one shots are obscure titles that most people have never heard of. That is, until Spy x Family launched in 2019. The series quickly established itself with its simple and complex themes. Mind you, the idea of a family of spies isn't exactly an unique idea, but it is the charm of the characters and refreshing writing style of the story that made this enjoyable from day one.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now you're asking yourself what exactly is Spy x Family? Do yourself favor and don't read the MAL synopsis as it may sound more complex than it looks. Meanwhile, you should watch the first episode and full indulge on what the author wanted to SHOW us. Watching the first episode brings together two characters with very different backgrounds and personalities - Loid Forger (also known as 'Twilight) and Anya. Loid proves himself to be a human with extraordinary skills in esponiage, physical feat, and master of disguise. You could say that he is the perfect spy. On the other hand, Anya is a young girl with the ability to read minds but also with a fascination of spies in the media. Watching their character chemistry immediately brings together a degree of elegance and charm. Let's just say how quickly the two connects with one another. Even though Anya knows Loid often lies to others for his work, she also knows that deep down, he is a kind hearted person. Representing the essence of a perfect spy, Loid deeply cares about his role but also has a soft side for his family.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We can't have a family without the mother of course. That's where the assassin, Yor Forger comes in. Introduced in second episode, Yor is essentially an assassin with deadly skills to match her intellect and physical talents. Although sometimes airheaded with a lack of common sense, she deeply cares about Anya and Loid despite not knowing their full backgrounds. In fact, you could easily call Yor and Loid's first encounter as a chance meeting. It's as if destiny set  these two up together. In perhaps one of the most memorable sequences of the this season, Loid ties the knot by putting a grenade pin on Yor's finger. It's a refreshing take as in most marriages, you see an generic type of ceremony with flowers and bridemaids. Obviously, Yor and Loid aren't actually a married couple a they pretend to be one to carry out their respective missions. And with Anya, they are the heart and soul of Spy x Family.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anya herself is a complex character despite her age. She has the ability to read minds and practically uses it as a necessity than just a helpful tool. It's with this ability that she barely gets into the prestigious Eden Academy. Academically wise, Anya is not intelligent and overly relies on her mind reading skill. From the first day of class, she isn't motivated and ends up falling asleep before her classmate Becky wakes her up. However, Anya makes an extreme impression towards her peers. Immediately, she is able to befriend Becky due to her kindhearted nature and standing up for her. Second, Anya also withstands another top student at the academy named Damian. Desmond. Proving herself to be a tough girl who isn't afraid to be pushed around by others, Anya withstands not just his verbal assault but also landing a fist into his face. It's the first time that Damian experiences defiance and thus, academy life for Anya becomes a whole lot more complicated.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But trust me, understanding Spy x Family isn't too complex despite the author setting up various degrees of storytelling segments. To tell a story like this, Tatsuya made each relevant character unique and carrying their own role. Anya, Loid, and Yor are the main characters but there are also others who makes an impact in the show such as housemaster Henry Henderson or Yor's brother Yuri. The anime give a great impression of the casts' personality to always get audience to react in some way. Anya is the most prominent case for her various degree of human expressions. Because of her mind reading talent, she often reacts in exaggerated ways like a kid her age would. Besides, who can ever forget about her iconic 'heh' face when she punched Damian's wind out? Let me just say that Anya is destined to belong in this show for everything she represent.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The big question to ultimately ask yourself is 'why should I watch Spy x Family'? After all, this just the first part and tip for the iceberg. To truly embrace into this franchise would mean to invest time into part 2 and the manga. However, I will say that Spy x Family is enjoyayble for all its character elements, comedy gags, and ultimatley the effective storytelling. It doesn't sell itself as an action thriller despite some of the advertised material. In today's anime industry where it's dominated by isekai, battle shounens, and rom-coms, Spy x Family is a breath of fresh air. Tatsuya Endo took this series into a lighthearted direction, a contrast to some of the action thrillers you're more used to seeing. According to the author himself, he often reads other works to brainstorm ideas of his own. By doing so, he invents and evolves his ideas into this series. It's what makes Spy x Family so special and amassing such a fanbase. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wit Studio and CloverWorks are not the perfect production studios but they managed to bring the creativity of Spy x Family in the most effective form possible. The theme songs are decorated with a simple and colorful chereography that further conveys the show's cheerfulness. Character designs for Anya, Loid, and Yor are unique and great to point out for their technical achievements. You can tell how their expressions are connected to their feelings when we see them in crucial scenes. Examples of these include the family's interview at Eden Academy or Anya's sincere apology to Damian. The fact is, human emotions is especially important for this show as it brings out the best out of its cast. Similarly, I applaud the voice actors for being spot on their roles, in particuar for Anya. It's not easy to voice a character at her age but she made the character as credible as she can be. Loid, Yor, and Damian are also voiced exactly as how I pictured from the manga and on point. In fact, I can say that this is one of the very few anime adaptation that may have exceeded its manga counterpart.\n",

      "If I said it once, I've said it a hundred times. Spy x Family is a contender for anime of the year. Yes, a show like this isn't absolute perfection but for what it has shown us, it captured just about everything I had expected and perhaps more. This is the type of show that is a refreshing breath of air that we need more often. And with part 2 to come, there's no better time than to jump into this hype train.\n",

      "                Spy X Family met and exceeded my expectations. Twilight's cold autistic behavior is well represented by his inner monologue, which is even a surprise, since his interaction with the adorable anya is quite charismatic, and all of this is elevated due to the direction, the comic timing, the faces and mouths, and the well-executed action that is very satisfying managing to mix the comedy with the serious moments. \n",

      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the characters:\r\n",
      "I talk about twinlight and call its behavior autistic because it actually is. Twilight misses some basic social cues (see how he broke up with the mobster's daughter), while being highly proficient in his field to the point of obsession. Stoicism implies none of this.\r\n",
      "Obviously there is no way to know about the future of the work, and whether it will go on to develop this psychology or have any arc about it, but twinlight is a character that has points to be explored.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What I also didn't expect was Anya to have flaws. She is not a Mary Sue super-genius character, but rather a normal girl for her age who uses her power to her best advantage, which is another fantastic angle to take. Particularly, Anya being more human in comparison to her parents who are quite problematic is great, even more so that her being a knowledgeable character could make the work smug, as the author could literally give conclusion to whatever he wanted using Anya, as her ability to read minds + an irrational intelligence, would only bring difficulties to the script, sensational move on the author's part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yor in my vision, is the most mysterious character in the work, it doesn't make her a bad character, but in my vision, she doesn't have any kind of problem either personal or mental like her family, even being an assassin, she is less rational and more emotional, struggling to keep herself disguised and not standing out too much.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The script is well written for parts of events, which are softly played before, but which are important later.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like the example in twinlight's scene where he says, \"I became a spy to make a world where children don't cry\" and right after the end of twinlight's encounter with the bad guys, he meets Anya again, and she uses this phrase that she only knows because of the power to read minds, as something to convince twinlight to take her again. She lies pretending that she was playing a game of catch and then shows her feelings by saying that she has been afraid, and then says: If you leave me behind. I'm going to cry.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing is the fact that the work gently reveals information about the twinlight, such as the fact that he is a master of disguise, and this is blurred because the scene of great impact is the sudden end and his comment about never wanting to have a family, but anyway these events are used in the same episode, as when he goes to rescue Anya, and the whole scene is about his disguise, which is a great scene precisely for the breach of expectation, but that already in the beginning was revealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About the script, Spy x Family is really great, it has spy scenes like the twinlight case, which amazingly... They are absolutely true. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the scene where twinlight fights the goons after rescuing Anya, he uses a trap with something totally realistic of the situation that was in that shed, which was flour.\r\n",
      "Flour has a lot of carbohydrate, that is, chain sugar molecules. When in powder form, carbohydrates are flammable, and in the particular case of flour, which is processed into very fine grains, fire spreads quickly. so the goons could not shoot at all, and not being able to see, twinlight could finish them all off with extreme ease. Absurdly well constructed scene.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spy x Family, objectively, this family! is a trio that replaces each other's weaknesses and supports each other. a spy, an assassin and an esper, each with their own conviction, flaws and secrets, As the story progresses, the characters learn what they lack and gradually improve.\r\n",
      "And all of this establishing a pattern of its own, it is definitely an excellent anime.\n",

      "\"I like this show\" ~Anya Forger in episode 1.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You could not have possibly missed this, Spy x Family has taken the community by storm. It is everywhere, be it in the form of Yor and Anya fanarts (with an appalling lack of Loid ones) or Anya smug face memes.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I simply have to praise the production of this. This is clearly a passion project, you can't tell the difference between Wit's episodes and Cloverwork's episodes, because it's so coordinated and seamless. The anime takes the manga's material and elevates it by leaps and bounds. The best example of this\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "is in ep 5, or the (I guess you can call it a filler?) episode where Anya makes Loid and his agents enact out her favourite scene of a tv series she watched. If this was picked up by any other anime studio, it would likely be presented as a minor, unimportant slideshow that took place in their house, just as the manga presented it. However with the production's emphasis on seamlessness, the anime does not merely animate only the panels itself, rather it adds to the panels, and it goes above and beyond to show the flow between the panels too. Thus, the anime manages to make a seemingly unimportant sequence in the manga into a full length episode that is almost completely anime-original, with stellar animation, and an amazing, though rather short fight scene between Loid and Yor. The sound design in the anime is also very fitting. The combination of spy thrillers and jazz music has always worked perfectly since forever, and Spy x Family is no exception. The main background “suspense” theme strikes that perfect balance to be noticeable enough to add to the mood of the scenes it's in, and also subtle enough to not be distracting. SxF uses this music really well, without going overboard with it.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This anime is called Spy x FAMILY, and one of the other key appeals of it is the dynamic of a found family that the anime creates. The facade of a family turns more and more into a genuine familial relationship as the anime goes on. This is made extremely clear to your face as the series goes on. Loid especially saw his family members at first as nothing more than a stepping stone to world peace. While he of course still sees them as tools to world peace, he also starts to genuinely care for them and look after his daughter’s well-being more and more out of love, and less out of obligation. He’s also uncharacteristically dense when it comes to Yor and her secret identity, which I find it funny above all else, but can be taken as a possible criticism. Yor and Anya’s relationship is also so heartwarming!! The most wholesome moments of Spy x Family for me at least, are the moments when Yor trains with Anya, both before the start of school, and the dodgeball match. I think the whole family dynamic is best exemplified in episode 4 during Anya’s interview to get into a prestigious school. Anya rates her parents with a “perfect 100 points”, spelling out their heartwarming familial relationship. The futility and stupidity of comparing parents, and worse trying to force a child to do it, is then embodied by a professor of that school, a rich, arrogant and pompous sadist. You are supposed to hate him, he was written to be hated, and the catharsis that the viewers experience after seeing Loid thoroughly intimidate him and causing the professor to be berated, though rather contrived and simplistic, is what helps us love and get behind this found family.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The primary appeal of Spy x Family isn't the thrilling spy action, its stunning production, or its found family aspect. These are great reasons to love this anime, but the main reason that this is so beloved by the community is its comedy, and the thing that ties all the comedy together, is Anya. Anya carries the comedy, no scratch that, Anya IS the comedy. The whole ED is dedicated to Anya. Most of the comedic scenes will somehow involve Anya in it, whether that be Anya's shocked expression whenever Loid or Yor think of something unhinged, or her smug face when something goes her way. Chances are, if you think Spy x Family is overrated, or you straight up dislike it, you probably do not like Anya as well. Ep 11 being considered to be the worst episode of the series by some, just because Anya acted a little more kid-like than those people were comfortable with, just proves this even further. The one major scene where Anya was not involved would be Yuri Briar's visit to the family, and for me at least, this was easily the most unfunny episode of Spy x Family. In fact, Anya waking up the following morning complaining about missing the excitement was easily the funniest part of the whole sequence. Anya’s antics and shenanigans in order to feel that sense of excitement and go “waku waku” reflects her mischievousness, her eagerness to save someone from drowning reflects her purity, Her studying hard to appease her father and in her mind achieve world peace reflects her child-like innocence and naivete, all of these make her such an endearing and adorable character. Of course, the people who understandably dislike Anya will probably think her actions are cringe, or her cuteness is forced, but i have to disagree there. I simply think she acts like a typical child would, and am more than willing to dismiss her occasional “cringe” moments simply as child-like naivete. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anya's ability to read minds is one of the most unique things about Spy x Family, and it's worth talking about a little. It’s the perfect excuse to create funny internal monologues. The 2 differing backgrounds and mentalities of Loid and Yor will almost always allow them to offer 2 vastly differing perspectives, and the fact that they are actively hiding their identities just make it even funnier. However in episode 3 it's also used to show the differing but mostly negative attitudes of attendees of a nationalist rally. While Loid points to the importance of educating Anya politically, all Anya does is get dizzy from all of the hate and patriotism of the members of the rally, reflecting the gross state of politics within the country. This so-called “gimmick” is genuinely really well explored so far, and I really look forward to seeing how else Anya’s ability will be used more later during Part 2 in Fall.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spy x Family being this popular due to its family-friendly accessibility and great writing just gives me hope that passion projects can still exist amid the endless drag of seasonal anime these days.

I mean, it might be a bit overhyped, but what isn’t these days? I expected a generic, uninteresting, gimmicky piece of shounen-action trash, and what I got was a clever and oh-so-endearing slice of life with lovable characters, fantastic visual set pieces, a brilliant setting, and, if you can believe it, a genuinely funny sense of humor and gut-busting comedic timing. It’s way more simplistic and tensionless than I expected it to be, and that is a good thing. I recently wrote\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "a review for 86 that went deeply misunderstood, and not just by the people who read my reviews solely to hate them. It was a tedious, four-paragraph review that takes three paragraphs to make even a single point, and while you’re probably falling asleep just listening to me describe it, I thought the tedium was worth it at the time of writing, because the point I was making was quite particular. My whole argument against the show was how poorly considered its presentation was; to quote everyone’s least favorite Greek snob, “86 plays out like a soap opera written by and aimed at teenagers who don’t really know anything about real war.” It’s horrible CG action, simpleminded social commentary, and unbelievable, generic characters were all legitimate issues, but what made the show truly unwatchable was its incongruous presentation that wanted you to view it as a serious war drama while also boasting the same moe fanservice and child-like, immature characters you’d see in any average highschool anime. SPY×FAMILY is the ultimate response to this critique. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is, if you haven’t figured it out by now, a show about a family of spies, but despite the gravity of their situations, the show does not take itself serious at all, and its presentation is consequently perfect. Twilight, our protagonist who I will henceforth be referring to by his alias, Loid, is a spy working for West German intelligence, and he’s tasked with making contact with a certain East German official who plans to turn the Cold War into a hot one. However, the only public appearances made by this individual are at his son’s school, where High Honor students are admitted into a fraternity where their parents can meet for pleasantries. In light of these circumstances, Loid is now in a position where he’s forced to find a wife and child, manage a believable appearance for this new fake family, and mold his new child into someone capable of earning their way into the fraternity and thereby handing Loid a meeting with his target. I know this premise already sounds a bit silly on its own, but only after you’ve actually sat down and watched the show will you be able to fully wrap your head around the true extent of its low-stakes, intentionally contrived, and often hysterically funny presentation and appreciate what makes its formula so entertaining and fun. Loid is a jack of all trades, but he is by no means a master of none, yet despite being comically proficient at everything, he’s limited by the fact his mission is totally out of his own hands, as he cannot rely on his usual wheelhouse of skills for this particular mission. It’s no longer a matter of stealth or brains, but rather a matter of your wife and child staying on script, and this is obviously far easier said than done.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Loid’s wife, Yor, is not only a completely air-headed idiot, but she’s also secretly an assassin—think Mr. & Mrs. Smith—and his new daughter, Anya, is not only a completely bumbling incompetent, but she’s also secretly an esper who can read minds. This set-up of having Loid and Yor oblivious to one another’s true dealings while Anya knows literally everything despite having none of the agency nor ability to actually effect any meaningful change is exquisitely balanced and, at least so far, has proven to be a Haruhi-level premise, only with less legendarily memorable characters. If we’re going to stick with the Mr. & Mrs. Smith comparison, it would be like if Brad Pitt had little to no understanding of human intimacy and connection, and Angelina Jolie was pretending to be a retard, while also being a genius…but then also…was a retard. The show is fucking funny, and every character is delightfully lovable almost instantly. There’s no stupid melodrama, and any serious emotional developments the series does contain are genuinely wholesome. One episode ends with a six minute long scene of two adult characters having a human conversation, reflecting on their personal memories and life choices, and while watching it I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Meanwhile, another episode ends with a ten minute long sequences of Loid playing Total Wipeout against an army of BND agents trying to reenact Anya’s favorite spy cartoon in a conveniently placed theme park castle right outside East Berlin, displaying what was perhaps the best action animation of the season on a literal, in-universe joke. And BOTH scenes worked marvelously.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking of the animation, the production of this series is probably its biggest downside, despite being well above average. There’s CG pedestrians, CG cars, and the usual, but the real continuous issue is the art direction. I understand the story is supposed to be taking place in East Germany, so there was clearly a vision to realize this drab, post-war, communist shithole, and in that sense the colors work perfectly, but I just wish they would’ve prioritized consistent detail. The backgrounds are just so empty sometimes, and it really undercuts how much effort the series puts in elsewhere. As for the actual artwork and animation, let’s just say you don’t have to wait until the credits roll to figure out which episodes were done by WIT Studio and which ones were done by Cloverworks. I mean, when one episode is mostly lip flapping and still characters storyboarded shot/reverse shot, and the next one immediately opens with the same scene of the same characters smacking each other across the room, moving all over the foreground and the background of shots, and being animated with multiple times the frames from needlessly difficult angles, then it’s not exactly a coincidence. I would describe the soundtrack the same way I would describe every other anime soundtrack that (K)NoW_NAME has done: fun, energetic, and, when necessary, absolutely badass. The character designs are excellent, and I’m not surprised this manga is a best-seller with these designs on the cover. Pretty much every major character has the ability to become an iconic design, and the artists behind this series fucking know it, because some of the facial expressions they pull out are priceless. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "It’s not just the designs, though. I keep failing to go in depth and really paint a picture of how charming this cast truly is, because they’re what really sells SPY×FAMILY and all that really matters within it. Loid feels like he was created in a laboratory designed to synthesize the most perfect heartthrob anime husbando imaginable, while also being a well-rounded, introspective, likable protagonist; Yor is equally perfect to carry the collective attention span of new-seasonal-waifu-seeking male otaku while simultaneously just being a good character; and Anya is simply irreplaceable. Everyone is familiar with the phrase, “a character is only as smart as their author,” right? Personally, I’ve always loved this phrase and agreed with it’s sentiment, but I’ve also found the inverse to be weirdly true as well. This is to say, a character can only really seem as stupid as their author is willing to make themselves, and it’s this phenomena which I think makes Anya such a perfect character. She is a child, and she’s written to act like a child and process things in a convincingly childish manner, but sometimes she’s strangely conniving, observant, and aware in a way that feels way too mature for the character she’s been sold as. Again—deliberate presentation, yada, yada, yada—this all works for aforementioned reasons, and it just makes her character so hilarious, because the author never hesitates to give Anya the punch line for a set-up no real child would have the social acumen to catch. I know I’ve been swearing by this show’s comedy insistently without providing anything to back up my claims, but I simply refuse to spoil any of the jokes in this review.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I’ve recently gotten a few comments on my page from people telling me they’re anticipating this review, and while sentiments like this always make my cold, icy heart flutter with the bliss of a true attention whore, they’ve also made me feel rather guilty, because I haven’t really done anything special with it, and this final paragraph won’t be making any effort to change that fact. I’ve had this issue over the course of the last few weeks with Paripi Koumei as well, where, after seeing the OP and hearing about the show second-hand, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to approach my eventual review, but when I actually went to watch the show, I was betrayed by its simplicity. It was just good—simple as that—and the reasons why it was good were very easy to say, so all my hollow drafts completely caved in on themselves, and I had to settle for a much more laid-back, two-paragraph review that covered everything it needed to cover in a fairly unexceptional manner, and I’m afraid the simplistic charm of SPY×FAMILY has left me in a similar situation. If you think slice of life is a worthless genre made for human sloths whose own lives are more boring than watching paint dry, then I guess I could recommend steering clear, but if anything I’ve described has sounded even remotely entertaining, then please remember the show itself is certainly going to be many times more enjoyable to you than reading my shitty writing will ever be. Yes, it’s been overly praised, so maybe don’t be expecting the next classic anime masterpiece in the making, and there’s nothing terribly revolutionary about its humor, but its formula is fresh, and its characters are the absolute dearest. \n",

      "                Spy × Family is a show about a spy, an assassin and a telepathic child who get together to form a made up family for reasons unknown to each other. And only the child knows the real identities & motivations of the parents, so naturally, many shenanigans unfold. Genius, right? No, because this show is fucking boring. I don’t know how you make such a premise boring, but that’s what they have accomplished here. You know the show Anya watches on TV—Spy Wars, I guarantee that that show is more fun than this one. \n",

      "Remember episode thirteen of Amagi Brilliant Park? Spoilers, I guess. It’s an episode about the mascots and the staff members of the park creating a new PV for advertisement purposes. And everyone just adds whatever the hell they want to this video ranging from a terminator style shoot-out scene to a clip of a horse giving birth. And at the end of the PV, it cuts to the main character—manager of the park staring at the unholy abomination in front of him in sheer & utter terror, realizing that if this gets released to the public, not only would he have to close the park down altogether but also hang himself in shame. It works because we—the audience have already spent twelve episodes with these characters, & therefore all their hysterically ridiculous behaviors make complete sense to us. Remember the Shrine incident from Nichijou? Mai is the one character in that anime who always manages to stay out of harm’s way. But the gravity of the fact that Mio had done her homework was so severe, even Mai couldn’t escape god’s wrath. And Mio was consistently presented as a character that never does her homework for many, many episodes. In fact, remember any joke from Nichijou? They’re all so meticulously constructed that even if you don’t laugh at them, you can still appreciate the stark intelligence behind them. Remember Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? The overarching joke is hidden behind so many layers, that to even realize there is a joke there in the first place, you’d need a PhD in comedy. Remember the baseball match from Suzumiya Haruhi? Remember the Crimson Mages from KonoSuba? Remember Nudist Beach from Kill la Kill? A construct, and a well-timed punch-line that subverts expectations are important aspects of comedy. Good comedy is creative, effortful and requires unadulterated engagement from the audience.\n",

      "But FUCK ALL THAT SHIT; TOO MUCH WORK. Let’s just put some dumbass in here with a mustache who yells out \"eleganto!\" every three seconds because HE HAS NO LIFE. I’m sorry, but do the script writers of this show think we’re baboons? Who would laugh at such uninspired, worthless, lowbrow attempts at humor? This kind of comedy would only work if the audience consisted entirely of seven year old children (no offense to any seven-year-old). The jokes that may have an initial appeal are repeated until you get physically nauseous from seeing the same facial expressions and reactions over and over again. The facial expressions and the reactions themselves will have more of a chance of putting you to sleep than making you laugh. None of the characters play off of each other in a satisfying manner. Not only does this show fail to play ball with the audience, but it also fails to play ball with itself.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let’s move on to the characters. The main characters in this anime act like robots that were programmed to be the most bland, boring non-characters ever. They are so dimensionless, that you could describe each of them in no more words than it would take you to spell out their full names. The side characters don’t even fucking exist. It’s impossible to describe them in any number of words because there’s literary nothing to them other than their names which I know no one remembers. I guess you could make the argument that the main characters are original, in the sense that they can’t really be found in any other anime. I don’t think that’s the case at all, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. However, the initial premise of a character being original means nothing when they’re one dimensional & act like cardboard cutouts anyway. In fact, you could replace any of these characters with cardboard cutouts and no one would even notice. All the supposed wholesome interactions between the main trio are so clichéd and hackneyed, that the only way anyone would think otherwise is if this was the very first shounen anime they have ever watched. I could go on...and I will. Ever heard of character development? Yeah, Spy × Family says no to that shit. Because that actually takes work, effort and planning. It takes real commitment from the audience. You know, like coming to sympathize with the characters or being invested in their personal drama. Literary anything other than \"oh, so wholesome.\" Anya could get run over by a bus, and I wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s no attachment, no sincerity, no nothing. Everything about this show feels like it came out of a best-selling shounen generator machine whose algorithm’s only purpose was to make as much money as possible and nothing more, and it seems to be working. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "*one spoiler*\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had high hopes at the start though. At least the shenanigans would be funny I thought. I was fucking wrong. They too devolved into the most unimaginative, pedestrian occurrences you could see coming from three hundred miles away. Anya saves a drowning kid and becomes a hero. I mean, holy shit, when have we ever seen that before? There was an incredibly novel incident called a dodge ball match with an antagonist kid who looked like a...actually, let’s not get into that. What else? There was a car chase. I distinctly remember something about a cow stampede. Oh, right. There was NOTHING ELSE worth mentioning because this show is the antithesis of creativity. Also, how does the spy—who should be keen & observant never notice that his wife is trained in assassination techniques? I understand that it’s done for the sake of comedy, but that doesn’t excuse such a blatant plot hole.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The presentation also falls short. Mainly due to its lifeless art style. When I first started watching, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The premise, by nature, is expressive & vivid. And the artwork spectacularly fails to be congruous with the tone of the show. WIT Studio and CloverWorks are two highly acclaimed studios in the industry. WIT Studio, especially, has a rabid fan base. On the other hand, though, CloverWorks’ catalogue isn’t nearly well-received, but they've proved they aren't completely worthless as a studio with shows like Akebi-chan, and Wonder Egg Priority (I hate Wonder Egg as much as you do, but the visuals are gorgeous), so naturally, I went in with sky-high expectations and what I got was a slap in the fucking face. The visuals are even blander than the characters, & that says something. Like I said, the premise is very expressive, but does anything about this show look expressive to you? Anya’s facial expressions are so barely animated that she looks more like a depressed fish. Yor’s ball throws break trees, & it’s supposed to be a joke, but because the art style is in such a dissonance with everything else, it feels completely unrealistic and the whole thing becomes funny for unintended reasons, which is one of the worst mistakes an anime can make. There’s cost-cutting everywhere to be found. There are also CG pedestrians & cars. I mean HOLY FUCKING HELL. A project by two highly acclaimed studios has THIS cheap a production? \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Where Spy × Family goes from mediocre to kingdom fuck though, is the art direction. The background art in this show, by definition, cannot be called \"art\" at all, because they’re a crime against art. They look like JPEGs taken from the original iPhone. They look like real life, if you are half blind. The level of detail had less depth than Anya’s cleavage—which is to say, NONE AT ALL. They were so unimaginably dimensionless, that I legitimately couldn’t tell whether they were CG or hand-drawn. But there’s no way any CG background would look this bad, so they must be hand-drawn. I was honestly in such a shock after witnessing the utter atrocity that is this show’s backgrounds, I decided to do some digging. And turns out, one of the art directors of this show was a background artist of fucking Fairy Tail. Do I really need to elaborate any further? Every building in this anime looks like it was designed in Roblox; everything is flat, straight, symmetrical & cynically lifeless. The architecture has the total personality of a fucking doorknob. The camera angles can vary from tactless & pathetic to straight up illogical. The shadows are either inconsistent with the angle of the light source or just completely fucking non-existent. The layouts are so unbearably monotonous that they could literary put you into a slumber where you endlessly dream about the falling standards of seasonal anime and despair in agony. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Watching this show was downright depressing. If you’re confused as to what I’m trying to say in the previous two paragraphs, I highly encourage you to watch March Comes in Like a Lion, Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept. The art direction of any one of those anime would’ve been perfect for Spy × Family. Their expressive art styles would’ve highly complemented Spy × Family’s expressive tone, especially ACCA’s. Of course, these are impossible hypotheticals, & they’re making me feel even more depressed. My shattered hopes will never be fixed. To mention some positives, though, a decent number of cuts in episode five were really well animated. The art direction was still worthless, but the animation was fluid and I was really happy to see that. I counted about five backgrounds throughout the show that weren’t terrible—weren’t good, but they didn’t make my eyes bleed. The OP & the ED songs are pretty catchy, and I found myself humming along at times. So it wasn’t one hundred percent awful after all. Anyway, I’ll conclude this train-wreck of a review now.\n",

Viewers learn that the state of this anime's world revolves around the incredibly strained relationships between two rivaling nations with heavy inspiration from East and West Germany during the Cold War Era and how our protagonist Loid Forger, a.k.a. Agent Twilight, a.k.a. best fake father and fake husband ever, is given a super special secret mission to get close to a leader of his opposing nation for the sake of striving for world peace. We're quickly given the scoop for what the anime is going to be about, and it's done well. I do wish there was a little more world building since aside from a few explanations of some jobs and roles that people have in this fictitious society, we don't get as much as I would like in terms of really fleshing out this world and making it feel like an immersive place that makes sense. But this isn't the primary focus of the anime and is still executed well enough, so this is mainly just me nitpicking a little. \n",

      "What Spy X Family truly is is a character focused comedy. I really enjoy how unlike other stories that try to hide a character's true role and motivations to be revealed near the end as some sort of plot twist, we know absolutely everything about these characters from the get-go. Everything is revealed to the viewer, and that unique yet excellent approach in my mind is one reason why this anime truly stands out. Now if the core cast were normal people, then this wouldn't be a big deal.\n",

And this is where the fun begins. He adopts a small girl named Anya...who can read everyone's mind...as his daughter and marries a bit of an airheaded woman named Yor...who assassinates people as a job. And where Spy X Family truly shines in my mind is in the bonds these three share. Each of them pose as a member of this family for their own secretive purposes, and it's just really engaging to see how they keep so much from each other while still slowly bonding and becoming a real family. Because damn, the author is excellent at depicting their relationships. So let's get into this trio!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anya actually acts like a child unlike most anime kids I've seen, and she's incredibly endearing. The girl craves excitement, and since she's the only one who knows everything that's going on, she loves this seemingly normal yet secretly crazy environment. And I would like to take a moment to mention just how great of a character Anya is in general. Of course she has her legendary meme face, but she's just such a fun character in all of her entirety. She has so many great moments across all the episodes and just really shines like a Stella Star. I'd honestly say that she's the most entertaining anime girl that I've seen in a long time. I actively burst out laughing during several of her moments, which is pretty rare for me. Anya truly is best daughter!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course there's also Yor, who is quite enjoyable in her own right. She's probably the most adorable house wife ever while also being a cold killer on her spare time. Huh, what a combo. She's pretty much the definition of both ditzy and deadly, and she combines her two sides in a crazy yet engaging way. Plus her bond with both Loid and Anya is incredibly cute. There are many adorable moments shared within this fake family. And while Loid himself is incredibly stoic and entirely focused on his mission, I really like how he connects with these two and acts as a straight man in many ridiculous scenarios. But he's not prone from doing ridiculous things himself. As the top spy in the world, I can assure you that Loid partakes in many over the top missions that put Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible to shame. Though each of their signature moves seems to be disguising as others so perfectly that they even take on their target's voice, so I guess they're both equally over the top. But it's certainly fun to watch. \n",

      "Spy X Family is a bundle of entertainment. I focused entirely on the core cast in this review, but the supporting characters like Damian and Becky are all enjoyable as well and bring a little something to the table. Especially during the school scenes. Seriously, those have no business being as entertaining as they are. When reading the Manga, those are the moments that stood out to me the most, and I'm glad to see them excellently adapted here. The Anya vs Damian moments like the punch scene and the dodge ball game especially made me burst out laughing, they're just so well done. I really have to give the combined efforts of Wit Studio and Cloverworks massive props for making such a brilliantly designed show. \n",

It has things that I'm sure mostly everyone could enjoy, so I'd wholeheartedly recommend this anime to pretty much anyone who enjoys comedy and likes over the top fun characters. Here's hoping for a sequel to continue Anya's quest at achieving world peace!...well, technically it's Loid's mission, but we all know that Anya is the true hero here.\n",

      "Story: 10\r\n",
      "The story of Spy x Family is a really fun story to come in to. It's a original story and does things different from the others. It is a action/comedy series and compensates it with a good story. The action in the series are good so far and\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "the comedy is most of the time Anya. Most comedy anime don't have a really strong story or the characters don't have a strong background, but I liked it when they teased the backstory of Anya and Loid in the first episode. \r\n",
      "There is a goal as well in this story. As I said it was to accomplish world peace and they do it in the most original way as possible. Without spoiling to much from what's coming, it is a very well written story with a lot of memorable characters so far!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Art: 9\r\n",
      "The best thing about the art is that they adapt panels of the manga so well! Some studios don't do this, so they get a more dramatic effect or a better visual, but in my opinion is this a really good adaptation from the manga. Wit and Cloverworks are 2 big animation studios and they did this story so right with there animations. So far they didn't disappoint at all!\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sound: 9\r\n",
      "The sound is very fitting for this type of anime. It really gives you the vibe of being in a undercover mission. And when the scene switch up to a more wholesome setting, the music switches to that really well! The OP is in my opinion really good because it really fits the show in every way (listening as a manga reader) and the ED is as good if not better then the opening! I maybe get why some people don't like the OP too much, but that is more of a taste thing.\n",

      "                Mediocrity can mask itself in funny ways. When I think of the word “overrated”, I think of shows that have been able to hide their mediocrity in such admirable fashion that they do not get noticed by the majority of anime fans. We’ve had our fair share of overrated anime like Clannad which was able to mask its mediocrity with emotional p0rn, No game no life, and even more recently Sono bisque doll with its uncanny ability to cater to the most down bad section of weebs. But no mediocre anime has been able to reach such heights of popularity as quickly and as effortlessly\n",
      "                  ...\n",
      "as Spy X family has.  Some of us are quick to convince ourselves that ratings don’t matter but when an anime(a first season at that) reaches so close to the top of the charts on this site before even clocking six episodes, there’s something in the works. This is my first complete review of an anime. I’ll try to keep things spoiler-free but some minor spoilers from the anime might spew out on account of my rage.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spy X family is the new anime on the block taken on by two popular studio veterans, Wit and Cloverworks, who know more than a thing or two about how to adapt a successful anime. If you haven’t been living under a rock for the past three months, you’ve probably heard about it. A spy on an undercover operation marries and adopts a child all in the name of avoiding war. The plot follows Twilight, a renowned spy who is tasked with investigating Donovan Desmond, who I think is a leader of some country, group, or something. Desmond apparently only shows his face in his child’s school thus sparking the culmination of convenient story arcs and just all-around nothingness that fails to leave me with much satisfaction or anticipation.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Spy X family falls short in quite a few areas starting from its overly convenient plot. There’s just too much that didn’t need to happen. Firstly, the existence of Yor. In what school do you need two parents to be present for an interview? Aren’t concepts like death, divorce, adoption, and many others present in this anime? This means that Yor has no right to be this integral to the plot this season. Now don’t get it twisted, I don’t hate Yor I think she’s a tolerable character but the way she was introduced to the story was stupid. The only reason she exists, to begin with, is to appear in Anya’s interview. She hasn’t done anything else to prove that she can be important to the overarching plot of the show yet. That might change but you have to admit that for now she’s kinda just flailing around having very little importance to the story so far and is mainly used as eye candy. I would rather have characters pop up randomly and then be included in the story rather than being included in the most ridiculous and unrealistic ways. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly, the dialogue. I value dialogue a lot in a story. A good dialogue aids in creating convincing characters by exposing essential details about their backgrounds, quirks, etc. It reveals aspects of characters that make them relatable. Spy X family does not excel here, unfortunately. The dialogue is forgettable and doesn’t leave me with any impression that these characters can be entertaining in any fashion. The most fascinating relationship is between Anya and Loid but that does not get explored enough or as in-depth as I would like. The other characters leave very much to be desired as well in terms of dialogue. The characters are not entertaining or thought-provoking. It’s not like the interactions between the characters are incredibly witty or funny, intellectual, natural, or realistic. The interactions between the three main characters seem lifeless at times and it feels like time is moving that much slower when I watch these characters communicate with each other. I feel like if an anime(A “comedy anime” at that) cannot establish some form of entertaining dialogue that goes past the stereotypical cheesiness that SXF advertises, then it is simply not worth my time. The dialogue is easily the weakest part of this show and when people such as me try to discuss these issues with Spy X family twerkers, it always comes back to one lazy ass point,” iT’s JuSt a SliCe Of LiFe CoMeDy iT’s NoT tHaT sErIoUs”. Okay, let’s address the comedy then.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When anyone criticizes the anime, the stans are so quick to say that it’s just a comedy slice of life and whatnot but here’s the twist, it’s not even that funny! Comedy is subjective and everything but I want to see the people that get a good laugh by watching some of the “comedic” scenes in this show. The comedy is repetitive with slow and awkward timing and it’s normally filled with Anya or Yor doing something over the top like slapping a relative until he starts bleeding or Anya falling on her face like an idiot. Also, can we talk about the fact that Anya, a four-year-old is being forced to an elite school with people two years older than her and not only expected to keep up with her elite classmates but to do so well academically that she gets a Stella? I feel like it’s another stupid and cruel attempt at comedic relief. Admittedly, the manga is a better representation of comedy but I feel like the anime’s shameless use of meme moments and explosive animation to pass off as comedy does not work for me. What makes it even more confusing is that it’s not hard to make me laugh. Some of my favorite comedy anime are trashy anime that don’t take themselves too seriously. The simplest joke can have my chest hurting from laughing too much. As with most “funny” anime these days, Spy X family is filled with wholesome moments that get the fans going. Watching Loid act like a dad is cute, Anya being stupid is cute, and Yor blushing for no reason is cute but it’s not funny at all. I can’t even think of an anime that came out in the past four or five years that hasn’t outrageously relied on these overused tropes and tried to pass it off as comedy.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This section will be dedicated to all the stupid things that didn’t need to happen. Can we talk about episode five? The most over-the-top celebration of a child going to school I have ever seen. Also, the organization that Loid works for made itself to be an absolute joke, and the “best” spies were just really dumbed down to fit the subplot which was to “save” Anya from a “villain”. In a show that people praise for its relatable slice-of-life moments, I don’t know how anyone could tolerate this episode. Another episode that didn’t advance the plot was that dodgeball episode. Never have I ever seen such attention to detail in a pointless episode that does nothing different than the previous episodes. I don’t think there’s been enough plot development to allow for irrelevant episodes. If Loid’s mission was so urgent that he had to enroll his four-year-old child in an elite school with people two years older than her then surely the plot should progress faster right? While we’re at it what about the backstories? Does Anya’s tragic backstory revealed to us in the earlier episodes play a part in the progression of the story? Certainly not. The show focuses on scenes that make the fan base melt over interesting scenes that reveal to the audience the implication and why that backstory is so relevant to the character. But instead, we had about two or three full episodes of not building up anything.  It’s such a shame because everything has been set up, the plot looks interesting, and the characters? Fairly bland but can improve if they focus more on the actual story. Ultimately, all we get is a poorly written slice-of-life anime with the occasional dark episode or two which I feel is a huge waste of potential.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To end this review let’s discuss some of the few moments where Spy X family showed the potential to be great. I could write about the art, music, or animation but I feel like that is already the topic of discussion in many other reviews of this show. What I want to focus on are the moments where there was potential for a good anime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First off, Anya passing the exam. We all knew that she was going to pass but seeing the genuine excitement from Loid as he sees her number on the board! One of the first instances we see a genuine father-daughter bond grow is during Loid and Anya's celebration together and it was honestly beautiful and relatable and is by far the best moment in the anime until it was ruined by that stupid hide and seek game. Another moment is where Loid lashes out during the interview. Again that did nothing but strengthen the bond between Loid and Anya. It showed that he is not just creating a family to fulfill his mission but he cares about Anya. The show clearly shows promise but it holds itself back from being good by always clicking the reset button on any meaningful progress, reducing it to a standard comedy series(depends on what your definition of comedy is) with no actual intention of advancing its plot so far. I’ve read a bit of the manga which suffers from the same problems as well. All in all, Spy X family is a disappointment but not an unsalvageable one. It showed good perhaps even great moments but not nearly enough to justify its incredibly high acclaim.\n",

      "Sifting through the list, you can maybe find 2 or 3 shows that may interest you to watch for like 3 episodes, and most of the time, even drop those shows. In the sea of trash, there's nothing much to be excited for unless there's a sequel to an already big show, an IP that is hyped up either by manga fans or light novel fans, or an anime with good marketing that you can't escape no matter where you go. This series right here ticks off 2 of the aforementioned factors (Japan hyped this adaptation so much and even the source material fans are talking like it's the second coming of Jesus Christ), but for all the right reasons. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "(I'll borrow an excerpt from my previous review for this series) Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "In it, we have a tsundere spy who is dead serious about saving the world and it's peace, an airheaded-but-lovable assassin that just wants to live and experience what \"normal\" is like, and a child telepath who does things to quench her entertainment. Result? A manzai trio in random situations, hilarity for sure will ensue. Spy x Family scratches every itch you might need from a comedic, family media and some action here and there. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was skeptical since Cloverworks did the infamous 2nd season of Promised Neverland and Wonder Egg Priority (I'm still salty about how they ended that), so I kept my expectations in a reasonable sense, but now considering it's a joint adaptation of WIT studio too, directed by one of the legends who gave us Mononoke and Dororo, Kazuhiro Furuhashi, I immediately knew that this series is in good hands. The setting with mid 20th century aesthetics sold me to pay attention to the backgrounds and how much work they put into a single frame, not on KyoAni levels of set design but this is also not something to scoff at too. The animations they did is A-tier, since Spy x Family is a visual heavy comedy and it relies visuals for punchlines and jokes to work, and no cap I think this is the strongest I've seen of both studios, incorporating the mundane storytelling of My Dress Up Darling and Akebi-chan with the insane choreographed fights of Vivy, it's an understatement to call this adaptation \"excellent\" because in my opinion, it exceeds excellency. The story is showing a side that I absolutely love, the fact they are not treating the world as real, so the animators can go ham with the comedy instead: the fact that Yor believes anything Loid says, Anya manipulating situations for her own satisfaction, and Loid being an inconsistent spy sometimes, that they can focus on how to build up scenarios instead, without shoving down your throat that you should believe in the scenes to your suspension of disbelief which also weirdly doesn't break immersion since the audience are willing to getting into it. Even though Spy x Family majors in comedy, if the story wants serious moments, it hits good. The last time I laughed this hard, even though I'd seen the source materials before the anime was Asobi Asobase and Grand Blue, for all these similar reasons.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I love everything about the audio of this show: from the voice actors, the sound design, the ambiance, the opening and ending song, they are all bangers. The cast is perfectly placed for everyone: the legends Hayami Saori, which is a perfect fit for a naive grown woman like Yor and big daddy ikemen-master Eguchi Takuya are just so versatile to whatever role they get but the important piece of the family is Anya's voice actor Atsumi Tanezaki, which at first glance, \"How can a someone who most likely plays soft-spoken characters can play a bombastic kid like Anya?\", but oh boi she proved me wrong. If I think about Tanezaki-san, I instantly think of Chise from Ancient Magus Bride, Rio Futaba from Bunny Girl Senpai, or Mizore from Hibike Euphonium, who are purely emotionless and doesn't talk much, she nailed those roles, but she made Anya literally sound like how a child would speak. Her childish sentence structures made it immersive especially if you understand Japanese, which I absolutely adore. It's so hard sometimes to find a series where characters act their age (e.g. Sangatsu no Lion and Pingpong the Animation) and that's what made Spy x Family great. Sound design, you can never go wrong if you have Shouji Hata-sensei on the directing role and Noriko Izumo for sound effects. These two knew each other well and very underrated on what they can do with the magic of sound. The audio team made the world super compelling throwing you back in the 1970's with crackling TV static and jazz on the radio, and oh my god, it felt nostalgic even if I didn't live that era. The opening visuals probably the best you could expect with a series of this setting since it also compliments the song choice; the song from HIGE DANdism is fitting to what the anime's message is trying to convey: a family built from lies and could fall apart easily, but where's the fun if you always try to be mundane, right? The OP is such a refreshing take of the \"entirely different artstyle from the main story\" troupe and made it fun as hell, as the drummer of the band would know (he came to music studio one day and dude said, \"Don't worry guys, I'll smash this\" and he did, the drums are fire bro). The ED tho, the song and the visuals made it so fun in a completely different sense, since it shows the perspective of Anya of her life and the happiness she always wanted, and Gen Hoshino, you thought the OP was great, but the ED juxtaposed a hype intro to a chill lo-fi vibe, which is a home run hit.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For all what's it worth, for a best-selling manga, there's just that satisfaction knowing the thing you liked has been adapted respectfully, and I love you Wit and Cloverworks for doing that. I don't want to make a longer wall of text so I'm gotta cut it short, so the show is essentially the full-package I could recommend to anyone who is looking for a different take in shounen with older MCs, character chemistry, with a pretty straight-forward plot that you can just chill on your couch and eat popcorn. If you liked a good comedy like Saiki K, Hinamatsuri, or Mob Psycho, I guarantee you will adore Spy x Family like I did.\n",
