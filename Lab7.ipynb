In this lab we will be looking at how we evaluate our models and what metrics we can use to see how our model is doing.\n",

As the names imply, the development set will be used for training and developing our model. Once we have a working model we can test it on our test set and get our evaluation metrics. \n",

    "The development set itself is further divided into a **training set** and a **development test set**. The training set is used to train our initial model and the development test set will be used to test our initial model and tweak it before testing it on our final test set. The reason for a separate development test set is that once we test our model on this test set and modify our model, this test set that we used can no longer give us accurate metrics for accuracy, since we used it to tweak the model. (Note that some people refer to this training + development test set as the **training set**. We are using the term **develoment** for the overall combination.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the next code block we generate a feature set from our data and split this up into the relevant sub sets. We first find out the length of the total data set and then we split it into 70% training, 20% development, and 10% testing."

    "- True Positives(TP): Items that were correctly labeled true\n",
    "- True Negatives(TN): Items that were correctly labeled false\n",
    "- False Positives(FP): Items that were incorrectly labeled true\n",
    "- False Negatives(FN): Items that were incorrectly labeled false\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the numbers for the above categories, we can calculate the precision and recall of our model. Precision will tell us how many of the retieved instances are correct or, in other words, how much we can trust the output. Recall, on the other hand, will tell us how many of the relevant instances are found. For a good read on precision and recall look at this [5 minute read](https://medium.com/@yashwant140393/the-3-pillars-of-binary-classification-accuracy-precision-recall-d2da3d09f664#:~:text=PRECISION%3A,total%20number%20of%20positive%20calls.)\n",

    "2. What is the precision and recall for female names?\n",
